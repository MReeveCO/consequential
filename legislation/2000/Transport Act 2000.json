the authorities, may provide a local service (an  \u201cinterim service\u201d) in the place of the original service or a part of it. 3 Subsection (2) has effect notwithstanding any prohibition, restriction or limitation on the power of the authority to provide local services contained in any other enactment, apart from the restriction in section 22 of the Bus Services Act 2017. 4 A franchising authority providing an interim service must have a  PSV  operator's licence to which no condition is attached under section 26 of the Transport Act 1985 (power of traffic commissioner to attach conditions to licence) prohibiting the authority from using vehicles under the licence to provide services of that description. 5 A franchising authority may not provide an interim service after the end of the period of six months beginning with the day on which the authority begins to provide the service, subject to subsection (7). 6 If\u2014 a an interim service is provided, and b the authority or authorities decide to enter into a local service contract with another person for the provision of a local service (a  \u201creplacement service\u201d) that would replace the original service or a part of it, section 123K(4) does not apply in relation to the provision of the replacement service. 7 If the authority or authorities enter into a local service contract for the provision of a replacement service, the authority or the authority providing the interim service may continue to provide it until the replacement service begins to be provided. 8 An interim service or replacement service need not be identical to the original service, or the part of the original service, that is replaced by the interim service or the replacement service (and such a change is not to be regarded as a variation of the scheme for the purposes of section 123M). 9 In this section  \u201c enactment \u201d includes an enactment comprised in subordinate legislation (within the meaning of the Interpretation Act 1978)."}, {"act": "Transport Act 2000", "year": 2000, "section": "123P", "section_title": "Service permits", "section_text": "123P 1 This section applies where a franchising

a new railway facility if the Regulator considers him to be an appropriate person to provide the new railway facility. 2 The Regulator may, on an application\u2014 a made by the Authority, or b made by any other person with the consent of the Authority, give to a person who has an estate or interest in, or right over, an existing railway facility a direction to improve or develop the railway

Making of applications for directions. 16C 1 An application for a direction under section 16A above must be made to the Regulator in writing. 2 The application must\u2014 a specify the person to whom the direction would be given; b state what it would require him to do; and c give the applicant\u2019s reasons for considering that person to be an appropriate person to do what the direction would require him to do. 3 The applicant may at any time vary what the direction would require that person to do by giving to the Regulator notice in writing of the variation; but if the applicant is a person other than the Authority such a notice may only be given with the consent of the Authority. 4 The application or notice of a variation may be accompanied by any written representations which the applicant wishes to make in relation to the direction.  Procedure for considering applications. 16D 1 When the Regulator has received the application or notice of a variation, he must\u2014 a send a copy to the person specified in the application, the Authority (if it is not the applicant) and any other persons who the Regulator considers ought to be sent one; and b invite them to make written representations within a period specified in the invitation. 2 If the person specified in the application makes representations that he is not an appropriate person to do what the direction would require him to do, the Regulator must decide that issue in advance of considering any other matters which may be relevant in deciding whether to give the direction. 3 If that person makes such representations but the Regulator decides that he is an appropriate person to do what the direction would require him to do, the Regulator must\u2014 a notify him of that decision; and b invite him to make written representations within a period specified in the invitation about any other matters which may be relevant in deciding whether to give the direction. 4 The Regulator must\u2014 a send the applicant a copy of any representations received by him in response to any invitation under subsection (1) or (3) above; and b invite him to make further written representations within a period specified in the invitation. 5 Subject to subsection (6) below, the Regulator may substitute as the applicant any other person if\u2014 a the applicant, b the other person, and c the Authority (if it is neither the applicant nor the other person), consent to the substitution. 6 The applicant may, by giving notice in writing to the Regulator, withdraw or suspend the application at any time before the Regulator decides whether to give the direction. 7 The Regulator may direct\u2014 a the person specified in the application, b the applicant, or c any other person (apart from the Authority), to provide him with any information required by him in order to decide whether to give the direction. 8 If a person fails to comply with a direction under subsection (7) above, the High Court or the Court of Session may, on the application of the Regulator, make such order as it thinks fit for requiring the failure to be made good. 9 Such an order may provide that all the costs or expenses of and incidental to the application shall be borne by\u2014 a the person who failed to comply; or b in the case of a company or other association, any officers who are responsible for the failure to comply.  Decisions on applications: adequate reward. 16E 1 The Regulator may only give a direction to a person under section 16A above to provide, improve or develop a railway facility if he is satisfied that the person will be adequately rewarded for providing, improving or developing the railway facility in accordance with the direction. 2 In considering whether he is so satisfied the Regulator shall take into account (in particular)\u2014 a any receipts obtained or likely to be obtained by the person (from the Authority, passengers, operators of railway services or any other persons) in connection with, or as a result of, the provision, improvement or development of the railway facility; and b any other benefit obtained or likely to be obtained by him in consequence of its provision, improvement or development. 3 Representations made by the applicant for a direction\u2014 a under section 16C(4) above, or b in response to an invitation under section 16D(4) above, may, in particular, include representations as to matters which he considers the Regulator should take into account in deciding whether the person to whom the direction would be given would be adequately rewarded for doing what it would require him to do.  Other provisions about decisions. 16F 1 If the Regulator does not consider it right to give a direction under section 16A above in the terms applied for (or to reject the application), he may give a direction under that section in modified terms. 2 The Regulator may include supplementary provisions in any direction under section 16A above, including (in particular)\u2014 a provision adding detail (for instance, as to the time by which, or standard to which, the person to whom it is given is to do anything which it requires him to do); and b provision imposing requirements on the applicant (for instance, to make arrangements for rewarding the person to whom the direction is given or to make payments to him). 3 Before giving a direction under section 16A above which is in modified terms or includes supplementary provisions, the Regulator shall\u2014 a notify his intention to give a direction to the applicant, the Authority (if it is not the applicant) and any other persons who the Regulator considers ought to be notified; and b invite them to make written representations within a period specified in the invitation; and if the applicant makes representations that the direction should not be given, the Regulator shall not give it. 4 Whatever the Regulator\u2019s decision on an application he shall notify the decision to\u2014 a the person specified in the application; b the applicant; and c any other persons who he considers ought to be notified. 5 The Regulator may direct the person specified in the application or the applicant to pay to\u2014 a the other of those persons, or b any other person directed to provide information under section 16D(7) above, any such amount as he considers appropriate in respect of costs incurred in connection with the application.  Directions: compliance, variation and revocation. 16G 1 A person shall not be regarded as failing to comply with a direction under section 16A above if he has done everything which it is reasonably practicable to do in order to comply with the direction. 2 If a person is unable to comply with such a direction because he does not have the necessary powers or rights (including rights over land), he shall not be taken to have done everything which it is reasonably practicable to do in order to comply with the direction unless he has done everything which it is reasonably practicable to do in order to obtain those powers or rights. 3 A direction under section 16A above may only be revoked or varied by the Regulator\u2014 a on the application of the person to whom the direction was given, the applicant for the direction or the Authority (if it was not the applicant); and b after consultation with the other persons with power to apply for a revocation or variation. 4 Such a direction may only be varied on an application by the applicant for the direction or the Authority if the Regulator is satisfied that the person to whom the direction was given will be adequately rewarded for providing, improving or developing the railway facility in accordance with the varied direction, taking into account (in particular) the matters specified in section 16E(2) above. 5 The Regulator may grant an application for the variation or revocation of a direction under section 16A above by the applicant for the direction or the Authority on condition that he or it secures that any such compensation as the Regulator may specify is paid to the person to whom the direction was given in respect of any liabilities incurred, or other things done, by him in complying with the direction.  Code of practice. 16H 1 The Regulator shall prepare, and from time to time revise, a code of practice supplementing sections 16A to 16G above and shall publish it in such manner as he considers appropriate. 2 The Regulator shall have regard to the code of practice in the exercise of his functions under those sections. 3 The code of practice may (in particular)\u2014 a set out minimum periods to be specified in invitations to make representations; b include provision about requesting the provision of information prior to giving a direction under section 16D(7) above; c specify principles according to which directions to pay costs are to be given under section 16F(5) above; and d make provision about the consultation required by section 16G(3)(b) above.  Supplementary. 16I 1 References in sections 16A to 16H above and this section to a railway facility include part of a railway facility. 2 Nothing in any of those sections or a direction under section 16A above\u2014 a limits any power of the Regulator under any other provision of this Act; or b affects any obligation to provide a new railway facility, or to improve or develop an existing railway facility, arising otherwise than from such a direction."}, {"act": "Transport Act 2000", "year": 2000, "section": "224", "section_title": " Amendment of objectives.", "section_text": "224 1 Section 4 of the  Railways Act 1993 (general duties of Regulator and Secretary of State) is amended as follows. 2 In subsection (1) (objectives)\u2014 a for \u201cSecretary of State and the Regulator shall each\u201d substitute  \u201c                          Regulator shall                        \u201d , b . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . c after paragraph (b) insert\u2014 ba to contribute to the development of an integrated system of transport of passengers and goods; bb to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development; ,  and d in paragraph (d) (promotion of competition in provision of railway services), insert at the end  \u201c                          for the benefit of users of railway services                        \u201d . 3 In subsection (2) (objectives)\u2014 a for \u201cSecretary of State and the Regulator shall each\u201d substitute  \u201c                          Regulator shall                        \u201d , and b omit \u201cthe Secretary of State or, as the case may be,\u201d. 4 In subsection (3) (safety and the environment), for \u201cSecretary of State and the Regulator shall each\u201d substitute  \u201c                      Regulator shall                    \u201d . 5 After that subsection insert\u2014 3A Subsections (1) to (3) above shall have effect in relation to the Secretary of State as in relation to the Regulator, except that in their application to the Secretary of State\u2014 a paragraph (za) of subsection (1) above shall be disregarded; and b the references in each of the subsections to the functions transferred or assigned to the Secretary of State under or by virtue of this Part include only the functions transferred or assigned to him under or by virtue of sections 6 to 22 and 37 to 50 below. 6 In subsection (5) (additional duties of Regulator), for paragraph (a) (duty until 31st December 1996 to take account of guidance of Secretary of State) substitute\u2014 a to have regard to any general guidance given to him by the Secretary of State about railway services or other matters relating to railways; . 7 After subsection (7) insert\u2014 7ZA Any general guidance given by the Secretary of State to the Regulator about railway services or other matters relating to railways\u2014 a shall be published by the Secretary of State in such manner as he considers appropriate; and b may be varied or revoked."}, {"act": "Transport Act 2000", "year": 2000, "section": "225", "section_title": " Penalties.", "section_text": "225 1 In the  Railways Act 1993, after section 57 insert\u2014  Penalties. 57A 1 If the appropriate authority is satisfied that a relevant operator has contravened or is contravening\u2014 a a relevant condition or requirement, or b a final or provisional order made by the appropriate authority, the appropriate authority may impose on the relevant operator a penalty of such amount as is reasonable. 2 A penalty is payable to the Authority. 3 The amount of a penalty imposed on a relevant operator may not exceed 10 per cent. of his turnover determined in accordance with an order made by the Secretary of State; and an order under this subsection shall not be made unless a draft of the statutory instrument containing it has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament. 4 No penalty may be imposed in respect of any contravention of a final or provisional order if provision was made in the order by virtue of section 55(7A) above in relation to the contravention. 5 The Authority shall not impose a penalty on a licence holder or person under closure restrictions unless\u2014 a it has given notice to the Regulator specifying a period within which he may give notice to it if he considers that the most appropriate way of proceeding is under the  Competition Act 1998; b that period has expired; and c the Regulator has not given notice to the Authority within that period that he so considers (or, if he has, he has withdrawn it). 6 The Regulator shall not impose a penalty if he is satisfied that the most appropriate way of proceeding is under the  Competition Act 1998.

Time limits. 57D 1 No penalty may be imposed in respect of a contravention by a relevant operator\u2014 a by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 57A above in a case where no final or provisional order has been made in relation to the contravention, or b by virtue of paragraph (b) of that subsection, unless a copy of the notice relating to the penalty under section 57C(1) above is served on the relevant operator within two years of the time of the contravention. 2 No penalty may be imposed in respect of a contravention by a relevant operator by virtue of section 57A(1)(a) above in a case where a final or provisional order has been made in relation to the contravention unless a copy of the notice relating to the penalty under section 57C(1) above is served on the relevant operator\u2014 a within three months of the confirmation of the provisional order or the making of the final order; or b where the provisional order is not confirmed, within six months of the making of the provisional order.  Interest and payment of instalments. 57E 1 If the whole or any part of a penalty is not paid by the date by which it is to be paid, the unpaid balance from time to time shall carry interest at the rate for the time being specified in section 17 of the  Judgments Act 1838. 2 If an application is made under subsection (8) of section 57C above in relation to a penalty, the penalty need not be paid until the application has been determined. 3 If the appropriate authority grants an application under that subsection in relation to a penalty but any portion of the penalty is not paid by the date specified in relation to it by the appropriate authority under that subsection, so much of the penalty as has not already been paid is to be paid immediately.  Validity and effect of penalties. 57F 1 If the relevant operator to whom a penalty order relates is aggrieved by a penalty and desires to question its validity on the ground\u2014 a that it was not within the powers of section 57A above, b that any of the requirements of section 57C above have not been complied with in relation to it and his interests have been substantially prejudiced by the non-compliance, or c that it was unreasonable of the appropriate authority not to grant an application under section 57C(8) above; he may make an application to the court under this section. 2 An application under this section by a person shall be made\u2014 a where it is on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(c) above, within 42 days from the date on which he is notified of the decision not to grant the application under section 57C(8) above, and b in any other case, within 42 days from the date of service on him of the notice under section 57C(6) above. 3 If an application is made under this section in relation to a penalty, the penalty need not be paid until the application has been determined. 4 On an application under this section on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(a) or (b) above the court, if satisfied that the ground is established, may quash the penalty or (instead of quashing it) make provision under either or both of paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (5) below. 5 The provision referred to in subsection (4) above is\u2014 a provision substituting a penalty of such lesser amount as the court considers appropriate in all the circumstances of the case; and b provision substituting as the date by which the penalty, or any portion of the penalty, is to be paid a date later than that specified in the notice under section 57C(6) above. 6 On an application under this section on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(c) above the court, if satisfied that the ground is established, may specify different dates by which different portions of the penalty are to be paid. 7 Where the court substitutes a penalty of a lesser amount it may require the payment of interest on the substituted penalty at such rate, and from such date, as it determines; and where it specifies as the date by which the penalty, or a portion of the penalty, is to be paid a date before the determination of the application it may require the payment of interest on the penalty, or portion, from that date at such rate as it determines. 8 Except as provided by this section, the validity of a penalty shall not be questioned by any legal proceedings whatever. 2 In section 55 of that Act (orders for securing compliance), for subsection (8) substitute\u2014 7A The provision that may be made in a final or provisional order includes, in particular, provision requiring the relevant operator to pay to the Authority in the event of any specified contravention of the order such reasonable sum in respect of the contravention as is specified in, or determined in accordance with, the order in such manner, at such place and by such date as is so specified or determined. 7B The amount of the sum may not exceed 10 per cent. of the turnover of the relevant operator determined in accordance with an order made by the Secretary of State; and an order under this subsection shall not be made unless a draft of the statutory instrument containing it has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament. 7C If the whole or any part of the sum is not paid by the date by which it is to be paid, the unpaid balance from time to time shall carry interest at the rate for the time being specified in section 17 of the  Judgments Act 1838."}, {"act": "Transport Act 2000", "year": 2000, "section": "226", "section_title": " Orders for securing compliance.", "section_text": "226 1 In section 55 of the  Railways Act 1993 (orders for securing compliance)\u2014 a in subsection (5) (cases where order shall not be made or confirmed) omit paragraphs (b) and (c), b after subsection (5A) insert\u2014 5B If the appropriate authority is satisfied\u2014 a that the relevant operator has agreed to take, and is taking, all such steps as it appears to the appropriate authority for the time being to be appropriate for the relevant operator to take for the purpose of securing or facilitating compliance with the condition or requirement in question, or b that the contravention or apprehended contravention will not adversely affect the interests of users of railway services or lead to any increase in public expenditure, it shall only make a final order, or make or confirm a provisional order, if it considers it appropriate to do so. , ... c . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 In section 56 of that Act (procedural requirements about orders)\u2014 a in subsection (1)(c) (requirement of at least 28 days\u2019 notice for making representations or objections to proposed final order or proposed confirmation of provisional order), for \u201c28\u201d substitute  \u201c                          21                        \u201d , b in subsection (4)(b) (requirement of at least 28 days\u2019 notice for making representations or objections to proposed modifications), for \u201cin that notice specify the period (not being less than 28\u201d substitute  \u201c                          unless the proposed modifications are trivial, in that notice specify a period (not being less than seven                        \u201d , and c in subsection (6)(b) (requirement of at least 28 days\u2019 notice for making representations or objections to proposal to revoke order), for \u201c28\u201d substitute  \u201c                          21                        \u201d ."}, {"act": "Transport Act 2000", "year": 2000, "section": "227", "section_title": " Renaming of committees.", "section_text": "227 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 Schedule 22 makes amendments in consequence of subsection (1). 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."}, {"act": "Transport Act 2000", "year": 2000, "section": "228", "section_title": " Extension of functions.", "section_text": "228 1   Section 76   of the  Railways Act 1993 (duties of Central Committee and consultative committees)   is amended   as follows. 2 In subsection (1)  ..., for paragraph (a) (duty to investigate any matter which relates to the provision of railway passenger services by the Board or a subsidiary, under a franchise agreement or on behalf of the Franchising Director) substitute\u2014 a to the provision of railway passenger services, or . 3 In\u2014 a subsection (5)(b) of section 76,  ... b . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
