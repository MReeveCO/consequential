\u201c attendance centre order \u201d. 3 The aggregate number of hours for which an attendance centre order may require a person to attend at an attendance centre shall not be less than 12 except

the times, if any, at which he normally works or attends school or any other educational establishment. 8 The first time at which the person is required to attend at an attendance centre shall be a

the officer in charge of the centre, having regard to the person\u2019s circumstances. 10 A person shall not be required under this section to attend at an attendance centre on more than one occasion
