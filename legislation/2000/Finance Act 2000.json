Failure to comply with fiscal mark regulations and public notices. 8E 1 This section applies if a person fails to comply with any requirement imposed by or under\u2014 a regulations made under section 8C above, or b a notice published under section 8D above. 2 Any article in respect of which the person fails to comply with the requirement shall be liable to forfeiture. 3 The person\u2019s failure to comply shall attract a penalty under section 9 of the  Finance Act 1994 (civil penalties). 4 The Commissioners may by regulations make such provision as is mentioned in subsection (5) below about the calculation of the penalty in a case where the failure involves post-dating of any tobacco products.

Offences: possession and sale  etc.  of unmarked tobacco. 8G 1 In this section \u201cunmarked products\" means tobacco products that are subject to fiscal marking but do not carry a compliant duty-paid fiscal mark. 2 For the purposes of this section \u201c duty-paid fiscal mark \u201d means a fiscal mark carried by tobacco products indicating that excise duty has been paid on the products. 3 For the purposes of this section a duty-paid fiscal mark carried by tobacco products of any description is \u201c compliant \u201d if it complies with all relevant requirements for any duty-paid fiscal mark that by virtue of this Act is required to be carried by such tobacco products of that description as are by virtue of this Act required to carry such a mark. For this purpose \u201c relevant requirement \u201d means a requirement, imposed by virtue of this Act, as to any of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (d) of section 8C(3) above (contents, appearance and positioning etc. of fiscal marks). 4 If a person\u2014 a is in possession of, transports or displays, or b sells, offers for sale or otherwise deals in, unmarked products then, except in such cases as may be prescribed in regulations made by the Commissioners, that person commits an offence and the products are liable to forfeiture. 5 It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (4) above to prove that the unmarked products were not required by virtue of this Act to carry a duty paid fiscal mark. 6 A person guilty of an offence under subsection (4) above shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.  Offences: use of premises for sale of unmarked tobacco. 8H 1 A manager of premises commits an offence if he suffers the premises to be used for the sale of unmarked products. In this section \u201c unmarked products \u201d has the same meaning as in section 8G above. 2 It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) above to prove that the unmarked products were not required by virtue of this Act to carry a duty-paid fiscal mark. For this purpose \u201c duty-paid fiscal mark \u201d has the same meaning as in section 8G above. 3 A person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) above shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale. 4 A court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) above may make an order prohibiting the use of the premises in question for the sale of tobacco products during a period specified in the order. 5 The period specified in an order under subsection (4) above shall not exceed six months; and the first day of the period shall be the day specified as such in the order. 6 A manager of premises commits an offence if he suffers the premises to be used in breach of an order under subsection (4) above. 7 A person guilty of an offence under subsection (6) above shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale. 8 For the purposes of this section a person is a manager of premises if he\u2014 a is entitled to control their use, b is entrusted with their management, or c is in charge of them.  Interfering with fiscal marks: penalties. 8J 1 This section applies where a person\u2014 a alters or overprints any fiscal mark carried by any tobacco products in compliance with any provision made under this Act, or b causes any such mark to be altered or overprinted. 2 His altering or overprinting of the mark, or his causing it to be altered or overprinted, shall attract a penalty under section 9 of the  Finance Act 1994 (civil penalties). 3 The products that carried the mark shall be liable to forfeiture. 4 The penalty under subsection (2) above shall be calculated by reference to the duty currently charged on the products.
