All minerals other than coal Paragraph 2 of Table. (1) This paragraph applies to any minerals other than coal.

justify the imposition of the restrictions, and shall be in such form, and accompanied by such information verified in such manner, as the Minister may direct. 3 The Minister shall consider the application, and shall, unless after communication with such other parties interested (if any) as he thinks fit, he is of opinion that a prima facie case is not made out, refer the matter to the

restrictions may be either on the quantity or position of the minerals to be worked, or on the methods of working or packing, or otherwise such as may be necessary to secure adequate support to the buildings or works or to prevent or minimise damage to them. 7 In determining whether restrictions should be imposed the court shall have regard to the value of the buildings or works or the cost of repairing damage likely to be caused to them by subsidence, as compared with the value of the minerals, or to the importance in the national interest of the erection or preservation of the buildings or works, as compared with the importance in the national interest of the working of the minerals. 8 For the purposes of this section, where any building or work is an ancient monument within the meaning of  the  Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979  and is, in pursuance of that Act, . . .   under the guardianship or protection of  the Secretary of State , or is under the
