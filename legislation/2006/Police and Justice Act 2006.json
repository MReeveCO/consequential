This is subject to sub-paragraph (9). 9 The Secretary of State, if satisfied that the proposed inspection\u2014 a would not impose an unreasonable burden on the organisation in question, or b would not do so if carried out in a particular manner, may give consent to the inspection being carried out, or being carried out in that manner. 10 The Secretary of State may by order make provision supplementing that made by this paragraph, including in particular\u2014 a provision about the form of notices; b provision prescribing the period within which notices are to be given; c provision prescribing circumstances in which notices are, or are not, to be made public; d provision for revising or withdrawing notices; e provision for setting aside notices not validly given.

Use of live link in sentencing hearings 57E 1 This section applies where the accused is convicted of the offence. 2 If it appears to the court by or before which the accused is convicted that it is likely that he will be held in custody during any sentencing hearing for the offence, the court may give a live link direction under this section in relation to that hearing. 3 A live link direction under this section is a direction requiring the accused, if he is being held in custody during the hearing, to attend it through a live link from the place at which he is being held. 4 Such a direction\u2014 a may be given by the court of its own motion or on an application by a party; and b may be given in relation to all subsequent sentencing hearings before the court or to such hearing or hearings as may be specified or described in the direction. 5 The court may not give such a direction unless\u2014 a the offender has given his consent to the direction; and b the court is satisfied that it is not contrary to the interests of justice to give the direction. 6 The court may rescind such a direction at any time before or during a hearing to which it relates if it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice to do so (but this does not affect the court's power to give a further live link direction in relation to the offender). The court may exercise this power of its own motion or on an application by a party. 7 The offender may not give oral evidence while attending a hearing through a live link by virtue of this section unless\u2014 a he consents to give evidence in that way; and b the court is satisfied that it is not contrary to the interests of justice for him to give it in that way. 8 The court must\u2014 a state in open court its reasons for refusing an application for, or for the rescission of, a live link direction under this section;
