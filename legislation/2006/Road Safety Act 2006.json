of a relevant drink offence by or before a court, b he has committed another relevant drink offence at any time during the period of ten years ending with the date of the conviction, c the court makes an order under section 34 of this Act but does not make an order under section 34A of this Act, and d the period stated by the court as that for which, apart from this section, he would be disqualified (\u201c the unreduced period \u201d) is not less than two years. 2 In this section  \u201c relevant drink offence \u201d means\u2014 a an offence under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 3A of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (causing death by careless driving when unfit to drive through drink) committed when unfit to drive through drink, b an offence under paragraph (b) of that subsection (causing death by careless driving with excess alcohol), c an offence under paragraph (c) of that subsection (failing to provide a specimen) where the specimen is required in connection

into an offence within any of the preceding paragraphs, or g an offence under section 7A(6) of that Act (failing to allow a specimen to be subjected to a laboratory test) in the course of an investigation into an offence within any of the preceding paragraphs. 3 Where this section applies, the court may specify a lesser period of disqualification (\u201cthe reduced period\u201d) if it also makes an order (an  \u201calcohol ignition interlock programme order\u201d) requiring the offender to comply with the alcohol ignition interlock conditions. 4 The difference between the unreduced period and the reduced period shall be a period specified in the order of\u2014 a not less than 12 months, and b not more than one half of the unreduced period. 5 If the offender contravenes the alcohol ignition interlock conditions, a further order under section 34 disqualifying him for the rest of the unreduced period is to be treated as having been made by the court immediately before the contravention. 6 \u201cThe alcohol ignition interlock conditions\u201d are that the offender\u2014 a must participate fully in an approved alcohol ignition interlock programme specified in the order during such part of the unreduced period as is so specified, and b during the part of that period following the reduced period, must not drive a motor vehicle unless it is fitted with an alcohol ignition interlock in good working order and must not drive a motor vehicle which is so fitted when not using the alcohol ignition interlock properly. 7 A court shall not make an alcohol ignition interlock programme order in the case of an offender unless\u2014 a the court is satisfied that a place on the approved alcohol ignition interlock programme specified in the order will be available for the offender, b the offender appears to the court to be of or over the age of 17, c the court has informed the offender (orally or in writing and in ordinary language) of the effect of the order and the amount of the fees which he is required to pay for the programme and when he must pay them, and d the offender has agreed that the order should be made. 8 For the purposes of this section an  \u201capproved alcohol ignition interlock programme\u201d is a programme approved by the appropriate national authority and involving the provision of an alcohol ignition interlock for use by the offender, training in its use and other education and counselling relating to the consumption of alcohol and driving. 9 For the purposes of this section  \u201c alcohol ignition interlock \u201d means a device\u2014 a of a type approved by the Secretary of State, and b designed to be fitted to a motor vehicle with the purpose of preventing the driving of the vehicle by a person who does not, both before starting driving the vehicle and at regular intervals while driving it, provide specimens of breath in which the proportion of alcohol is likely not to exceed the limit specified in subsection (10) below. 10 That limit is 9 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath or such other proportion of alcohol to breath as the Secretary of State may by regulations prescribe. 11 For the purposes of this section an offender uses an alcohol ignition interlock properly if (and only if) he is complying with all the instructions given to him about its use as part of the approved alcohol ignition interlock programme. 12 Where an alcohol ignition interlock is fitted to a motor vehicle as part of an approved alcohol ignition interlock programme relating to an offender, a person commits an offence if\u2014 a he interferes with the alcohol ignition interlock with intent to cause it not to function or not to function properly, or b he is a person other than the offender and provides or attempts to provide a specimen of breath for the purposes of the alcohol ignition interlock with intent to enable the driving (or continued driving) of the vehicle by the offender.
