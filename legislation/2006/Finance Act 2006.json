Sections 184A and 184B:  \u201cpre-change assets\u201d: basic rules 184E 1 If\u2014 a a company other than the relevant company makes a disposal of an asset, and b the asset has been disposed of at any time after the relevant time by a disposal to which section 171(1) does not apply (a  \u201cnon-section 171(1) transfer\u201d), the asset ceases to be regarded as a pre-change asset for the purposes of sections 184A and 184B (but see also subsections (10) and (11)). 2 But (without affecting the generality of the provision made by the following subsection) if, on a non-section 171(1) transfer,\u2014 a an asset would cease to be regarded as a pre-change asset as a result of subsection (1), and b the company making the non-section 171(1) transfer retains any interest in or over the asset, that interest is to be regarded as a pre-change asset for the purposes of sections 184A and 184B. 3 If\u2014 a the relevant company or any other company holds an asset (\u201cthe new asset\u201d) at or after the relevant time, b the value of the new asset derives in whole or in part from a pre-change asset, and c the new asset is not acquired by the company concerned as a result of a non-section 171(1) transfer, the new asset is also to be regarded as a pre-change asset for the purposes of sections 184A and 184B. 4 For this purpose the cases in which the value of an asset may be derived from any other asset include any case where\u2014 a assets have been merged or divided, b assets have changed their nature, or c rights or interests in or over assets have been created or extinguished. 5 If a pre-change asset is  \u201c the old asset \u201d for the purposes of section 116 (reorganisations, conversions and reconstructions),  \u201c the new asset \u201d for the purposes of that section is also to be regarded as a pre-change asset for the purposes of sections 184A and 184B. 6 If a pre-change asset is the  \u201c original shares \u201d for the purposes of sections 127 to 131 (reorganisation or reduction of share capital), the  \u201c new holding \u201d for the purposes of those sections is also to be regarded as a pre-change asset for the purposes of sections 184A and 184B. 7 The following subsection applies if, as a result of the application of a relevant deferral provision in the case of a disposal of a pre-change asset (\u201cthe original disposal\u201d),\u2014 a a gain or loss that would otherwise accrue to a company does not so accrue, or b any part of any such gain is treated as forming part of a single chargeable gain which does not accrue to the company on the original disposal, and a gain or loss does, wholly or partly in consequence of the application of that provision in the case of the original disposal, accrue to the company or any other company on a subsequent occasion. 8 So much of the gain or loss accruing on the subsequent occasion as accrues in consequence of the application of the relevant deferral provision in the case of the original disposal is to be regarded for the purposes of sections 184A and 184B as accruing on a disposal of a pre-change asset (so far as it would not otherwise be so regarded). 9 A  \u201c relevant deferral provision \u201d means any of the following\u2014 a section 139 (reconstruction involving transfer of business), b section 140 (postponement of charge on transfer of assets to non-resident company), c section 140A (transfer of a UK trade), d section 140E (merger leaving assets within UK tax charge), e sections 152 and 153 (replacement of business assets), f section 187 (postponement of charge on deemed disposal under section 185). 10 If\u2014 a a pre-change asset of the relevant company is transferred to another company (\u201c the transferee company \u201d), b any of sections 139, 140A and 140E apply to the companies in the case of the asset, and c the transfer of the asset is made directly or indirectly in consequence of, or otherwise in connection with, the arrangements mentioned in section 184A or 184B, the asset is to be regarded as a  \u201cpre-change asset\u201d in the hands of the transferee company for the purposes of sections 184A and 184B. 11 In such a case, subsection (1) applies as if the reference in paragraph (a) of that subsection to the relevant company were to the transferee company. Sections 184A and 184B:  \u201cpre-change assets\u201d: pooling rules 184F 1 This section applies, in the case of any pre-change asset of the relevant company or any pre-change asset of any company which is acquired on a disposal to which section 171(1) applies, if\u2014 a the pre-change asset consists of a holding of securities which falls as a result of any provision of Chapter 1 of Part 4 to be regarded as a single asset (\u201cthe pre-change pooled asset\u201d), and b as a result of any disposal or acquisition at any time after the relevant time, any securities (\u201cthe other securities\u201d) would (but for this section) be regarded as forming part of the pre-change pooled asset. 2 None of the other securities are to be regarded for the purposes of this Act as forming part of the pre-change pooled asset. 3 But this does not prevent the other securities from being regarded, as a result of any provision of that Chapter, as forming part of or constituting a different, single asset (\u201cthe other pooled asset\u201d). 4 Securities of the same class as the other securities which are disposed of at or after the relevant time\u2014 a are to be identified first with the other securities or securities forming part of the other pooled asset, b are to be identified next with securities forming part of the pre-change pooled asset (if the number of securities disposed of exceeds the number identified in accordance with paragraph (a)), and c subject to paragraphs (a) and (b), are to be identified in accordance with the provisions applicable apart from those paragraphs. 5 The above identification rules apply even if some or all of the securities disposed of are otherwise identified\u2014 a by the disposal, or b by a transfer or delivery giving effect to it; but where a company disposes of securities in one capacity, they are not to be identified with securities which it holds, or can dispose of, only in some other capacity. 6 Chapter 1 of Part 4 has effect subject to this section. 7 In this section\u2014 \u201c pre-change asset \u201d means an asset which is pre-change asset for the purposes of section 184A or 184B, \u201c securities \u201d does not include relevant securities as defined in section 108 but, subject to that, means\u2014 shares or securities of a company, and any other assets where they are of a nature to be dealt in without identifying the particular assets disposed of or acquired. 8 For the purposes of this section, shares or securities of a company are not to be treated as being of the same class unless\u2014 a they are so treated by the practice of a recognised stock exchange, or b they would be so treated if dealt with on a recognised stock exchange. . 3 In Schedule 7A (restriction on set-off of pre-entry losses), in paragraph 1(1)\t\t\t\t\t(application of Schedule), at the end insert  \u201c                      , but this Schedule shall have no effect in any case where section 184A (restrictions on buying losses: tax avoidance schemes) has effect in relation to those losses                    \u201d . 4 Section 177B and Schedule 7AA (restrictions on setting losses against pre-entry gains) shall cease to have effect. 5 In section 213 (insurance companies: spreading of gains and losses under section 212)\u2014 a in subsection (8H) for  \u201cthat the net amount is\u201d to the end substitute  \u201c                          that the net amount would still arise even if losses accruing after the date on which the company or transferee joined the group of companies were disregarded                        \u201d , and b in subsection (8I) for  \u201cparagraph 1\u201d to the end substitute  \u201c                          section 184C as if those references were contained in that section; and in subsection (8A)(b) above  \u201c group \u201d has the same meaning as in that section                        \u201d . The amendments made by this subsection have effect where the accounting period for which the net amount represents an excess of losses over gains is an accounting period ending on or after 5th December 2005. 6 The amendments made by this section, other than subsection (5), have effect for calculating the amount to be included in respect of chargeable gains in a company's total profits for any accounting period ending on or after 5th December 2005. 7 But, in respect of any such accounting period, those amendments do not have effect in relation to the deduction of any loss from chargeable gains that accrue on any disposal made before 5th December 2005 unless that loss accrues on a disposal made on or after that date. 8 For the purposes of those amendments, it does not matter whether a qualifying change of ownership in relation to a company occurs\u2014 a before 5th December 2005, or b on or after that date. 9 Subsections (10) to (12) apply  so long as each of the following conditions is met\u2014 a at any time (\u201c the relevant time \u201d) before 5th December 2005 there is a qualifying change of ownership in relation to a company (\u201c the relevant company \u201d) for the purposes of section 184A  . . .   of TCGA 1992, b the change of ownership occurs because the relevant company ceases to be a member of a group of companies at the relevant time (whether or not it also occurs for any other reason), c the principal company of that group has control of the relevant company at the relevant time and at   immediately afterwards, ca no qualifying change of ownership occurs at any time in relation to the principal company of that group for the purposes of section 184A of TCGA 1992 directly or indirectly in consequence of, or otherwise in connection with, any arrangements the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which is to secure a tax advantage falling within subsection (1)(d) of that section, and d . . . . . . . . . . . . .

December 2005. 10 Subsection (2) of that section has effect in relation to that qualifying loss subject to the following modifications. 11 That subsection has effect as if there were inserted at the end of it unless the gains accrue to the company on a disposal of a pre-change asset. 12 That subsection (modified as mentioned above) has effect as if the reference to a pre-change asset included an asset held before the relevant time by any company\u2014 a which, immediately before that time, was a member of the same group of companies as the relevant company, and b which, throughout the period beginning with that time and ending immediately after the making of the disposal referred to in that subsection, has remained under the control of the company which was the principal company of that group at the relevant time. 13 Expressions which are used in subsections (9) to (12) have the same meaning as in sections 184A and 184C of TCGA 1992."}, {"act": "Finance Act 2006", "year": 2006,

Condition A is that\u2014 a any receipt arises to a company (\u201c the relevant company \u201d) on a disposal of an asset, and b the receipt arises directly or indirectly in consequence of, or

applicable 90 day period, or b the earlier amendment of its company tax return for the purpose of complying with the provision referred to in the notice. 10 If the relevant notice is given to the company after any enquiries into the return for the period are completed, no discovery assessment may be made as regards the chargeable gain to which the notice relates until\u2014 a the end of the applicable 90 day period, or b the earlier amendment of the company tax return for the purpose of complying with the provision referred to in the notice. 11 Subsections (2)(b) and (8) do not prevent a

plant or machinery subject to a lease to another person, c the lessor remains entitled immediately after the disposal to some or all of the rentals under the lease in respect of the plant or machinery which are payable on or after the relevant day, and d the lessor is required to bring a disposal value of the plant or machinery into account under this Part. 2 The disposal value to be brought into account is determined as follows. 3 If the amount or value of the consideration for the disposal exceeds the limit that would otherwise be imposed on the amount of the disposal value by section 62 (general limit) or 239 (limit on disposal value where additional VAT rebate)\u2014 a that limit is not to apply, and b the whole of the amount or value of the consideration for the disposal is to be

the value of the rentals under the lease in respect of the plant or machinery (see subsections (7) and (8)) which are payable on or after the relevant day and to which the lessor remains entitled immediately after the disposal, but subject to the limit imposed on the amount of the disposal value by section 62 or 239. 5 If\u2014 a any of the rentals under the lease are receivable by the lessor

value as so represented is left out of account in calculating the income of the lessor's leasing business for corporation tax purposes. 6 If, in determining under subsection (5) the amount of any rental to be so left out of account, it is necessary to apportion the amount of the rental, the apportionment is to be made on a just and reasonable basis. 7 For the purposes of this section, the value of any rentals under the lease in respect of the plant or machinery is taken to be the amount of the net present value of the rentals (see section 228L). 8 If any land or other asset which is not plant or machinery is subject to the lease, the value of any rentals under the lease in respect of the plant or machinery is taken to be so much of the amount of the net present value of the

rentals), and b section 228M (which defines other expressions used in this section). Determining the net present value of the rentals for purposes of s.228K 228L 1 For the purposes of section 228K, the amount of the net present value of the rentals is calculated as follows\u2014 Step 1 Find the amount (\u201cRI\u201d) of each rental payment\u2014 a which is payable at any time during the term of the lease, and b which is payable on or after the relevant day. Step 2 For each rental payment find the day (\u201cthe payment day\u201d) on which it becomes payable. Step 3 For each rental payment find the number of days in the period (\u201cP\u201d) which\u2014 a begins with the relevant day, and b ends with the payment day. Step 4 Calculate the net present value of each payment (\u201cNPVRI\u201d) by applying the following formula\u2014 RI ( 1 + T ) i where\u2014 T is the temporal discount rate, and i is the number of days in P divided by 365. Step 5 Add together each amount of NPVRI determined under step 4. 2 For the purposes of this section the  \u201cterm\u201d of a lease has the meaning given in Chapter 6A of this Part. 3 For the purposes of this section the  \u201ctemporal discount rate\u201d is 3.5% or such other rate as may be specified by regulations made by the Treasury. 4 The regulations may make such provision as is mentioned in subsection (3)(b) to (f) of section 178 of FA 1989 (power of Treasury to set rates of interest). 5 Subsection (5) of that section (power of Commissioners to specify rate by order in certain circumstances) applies in relation to regulations under this section as it applies in relation to regulations under that section.

in Schedule 3 (petroleum revenue tax: miscellaneous provisions) before paragraph 2 (definition of market value of oil) insert\u2014 Determination of market value: the notional delivery day for a quantity of oil 1A 1 This paragraph has effect for determining, for the purposes of this Schedule, the day which is the  \u201cnotional delivery day\u201d in the case of any particular quantity of oil of any particular kind whose market value falls to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule in the case of any chargeable period. 2 The notional delivery day need not be a day in the chargeable period. 3 In the case of a quantity of oil which, at the end of the chargeable period,\u2014 a has neither been disposed of nor relevantly appropriated in the period, or b has been disposed of but not delivered in the period, the notional delivery day is the last business day of the chargeable period. 4 In the case of\u2014 a a quantity of oil won and disposed of which is delivered on a day in the chargeable period, or b a quantity of oil\u2014 i relevantly appropriated on a day in the chargeable period, but ii not disposed of in the chargeable period, the notional delivery day is to be determined in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5) to (7) below. 5 If that oil is\u2014 a oil transported by ship from the place of extraction to a place in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, or b oil transported by pipeline to a place in the United Kingdom and loaded on to a ship there, and there is a loading slot for it (see sub-paragraph (8)), the notional delivery day is the middle day of the loading slot. 6 If sub-paragraph (5) above does not apply to that oil, then\u2014 a if it is oil delivered on a day in the chargeable period, the notional delivery day is the date of the delivery, or b if it is oil relevantly appropriated on a day in the chargeable period, the notional delivery day is the date of the appropriation. 7 The Treasury may by regulations make provision for or in connection with substituting as the notional delivery day in such circumstances as may be prescribed\u2014 a in the case of oil transported by ship from the place of extraction to a place in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, the date of completion of load, or b in the case of oil transported by pipeline to a place in the United Kingdom and loaded on to a ship there, the date of the bill of lading. 8 The  \u201cloading slot\u201d for any oil is the period of three days within which the loading of the oil on to the ship is or was to take place\u2014 a as duly published by the operator of the facility at which that loading is or was to take place (unless paragraph (b) below applies), or b as subsequently finally duly varied to give effect to any modifications duly notified to that operator by the participator concerned. 9 In sub-paragraph (8) above,  \u201c duly \u201d means in accordance with the arrangements for the time being governing the time and manner of\u2014 a publication, or variation, of the final loading schedule for the calendar month in which loading is or was to take place, or b notification of modifications to that schedule, and, in any case, before the end of the calendar month immediately preceding that in which loading is to take place. 10 If the Treasury consider that, for the purpose of defining  \u201cloading slot\u201d, any period of days for the time being specified by or under this Act as the period of days within which loading of oil on to a ship is to take place is, or is to be, no longer appropriate, they may by regulations make provision for, or in connection with,\u2014 a varying the number of days in the period, b determining the day that is to be the notional delivery day if the number, as varied, is an even number. The power conferred by this sub-paragraph includes power to make amendments to, or modifications of, this Schedule. . 2 Paragraph 2 of that Schedule (definition of market value of oil) is amended as follows. 3 In sub-paragraph (1)\t\t\t\t\t(market value of oil in any calendar month to be determined in accordance with the paragraph) for  \u201cany oil in any calendar month\u201d substitute  \u201c                    any particular quantity of oil of any kind on any day                  \u201d . 4 After sub-paragraph (1) insert\u2014 1A This paragraph makes different provision according to whether the oil is\u2014 a Category 1 oil of any kind, or b Category 2 oil of any kind. 1B For the purposes of this Act\u2014 a Category 1 oil is oil of any of one or more kinds specified as such in regulations made for the purpose by the Board; b Category 2 oil is oil of any other kind. 1C The Board may specify oil of any particular kind as Category 1 oil only if they are satisfied that reports of prices for sales of oil of that kind are published and widely available (whether or not on payment of a fee). . 5 For sub-paragraph (2) substitute\u2014 2 The market value of any particular quantity of Category 1 oil of any kind is the price for which that quantity of oil of that kind might reasonably have been expected to be sold under a contract of sale that meets the following conditions\u2014 a the contract is for the sale of the oil at arm's length to a willing buyer; b the contract is for delivery of a single standard cargo of the oil; c the contract specifies a period of three days within which loading of the oil is to take place and that period includes the notional delivery day for the actual oil; d the contract requires the oil to have been subjected to appropriate initial treatment before delivery; e the contract requires the oil to be delivered\u2014 i in the case of oil extracted in the United Kingdom, at the place of extraction; or ii in the case of oil extracted from strata in the sea bed and subsoil of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom or of a designated area, at the place in the United Kingdom or another country at which the seller could reasonably be expected to deliver it or, if there is more than one such place, the one nearest to the place of extraction. The terms as to payment which are to be implied in the contract are those which are customarily contained in contracts for the sale at arm's length of oil of the kind in question. 2AA The market value of any particular quantity of Category 2 oil of any kind is the price for which that quantity of oil of that kind might reasonably have been expected to be sold under a contract of sale that meets the following conditions\u2014 a the contract is for the sale of the oil at arm's length to a willing buyer; b the contract provides for delivery of the oil on the notional delivery day for the actual oil or within such period that includes that day as is normal under a contract at arm's length for the sale of oil of that kind (or, if there is more than one such period, the shortest of them); c the contract is made on a date such that the period between that date and the notional delivery day for the actual oil is the normal period between contract and delivery in the case of a contract at arm's length for the sale of oil of that kind (or, if there is more than one such period, the shortest of them); d the contract requires the oil to have been subjected to appropriate initial treatment before delivery; e the contract requires the oil to be delivered\u2014 i in the case of oil extracted in the United Kingdom, at the place of extraction; or ii in the case of oil extracted from strata in the sea bed and subsoil of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom or of a designated area, at the place in the United Kingdom or another country at which the seller could reasonably be expected to deliver it or, if there is more than one such place, the one nearest to the place of extraction.

sub-paragraphs (2A) to (2D) substitute\u2014 2E For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) or (2AA) above, the price of any quantity of Category 1 or Category 2 oil of any kind shall be determined in such manner, on the basis of such information, and by reference to such factors, as may be prescribed for oil of that Category and kind in regulations made by the Board. 2F The provision that may be made by regulations under subsection (2E) above includes provision for or in connection with any or all of the following\u2014 a determining the price by reference to prices, or an average of prices, for sales of oil (whether or not oil of the Category or kind in question, and whether the prices are prices under actual contracts, prices that are published and widely available (whether on payment of a fee or otherwise) or prices ascertained or determined in some other way); b the prices to be taken into account; c the descriptions of contracts to be taken into account; d the method to be used for determining an average of prices; e the day or days, or period or periods, by reference to which prices, or any average of prices, is to be determined; f the application of a prescribed price differential, in cases where the price of oil of one kind falls to be determined in whole or in part by reference to prices for oil of some other kind. 2G Sub-paragraph (2I) below has effect if, or in so far as, the Board are satisfied that it is impracticable or inappropriate to determine for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) or (2AA) above the price of any oil in accordance with the provisions of regulations for the time being in force under sub-paragraph (2E) above. 2H For that purpose it is immaterial whether the impracticability or inappropriateness is by virtue of\u2014 a an insufficiency of contracts or published prices that satisfy the conditions, b an insufficiency of information relating to such contracts or published prices, or c the nature of the market for oil of the kind in question, or for any other reason. 2I Where this sub-paragraph has effect, the price is to be determined\u2014 a so far as it is practicable and appropriate to do so by reference to other contracts or published prices (whether or not relating to oil of the same kind) and in accordance with the principles set out in the regulations for determining an average of prices; and b so far as it is not practicable or appropriate to determine it as mentioned in paragraph (a) above, in such other manner as appears to the Board to be appropriate in the circumstances. . 7 Omit sub-paragraph
