Review of polling districts and places: representations to Electoral Commission 18D 1 This section applies if in relation to a constituency in the area of a relevant authority a relevant representation is made to the Electoral Commission by\u2014 a an interested authority in England and Wales; b not less than 30 electors in the constituency; c a person (other than the returning officer) who has made representations under Schedule A1; d a person who is not an elector in a constituency in the authority's area but who the Commission think has sufficient interest in the accessibility of disabled persons to polling places in the area or has particular expertise in relation to the access to premises or facilities of disabled persons. 2 A relevant representation is a representation that a review under section 18A or 18B has not been conducted by a relevant authority so as to\u2014 a meet the reasonable requirements of the electors in the constituency or any body of those electors, or b take sufficient account of the accessibility to disabled persons of polling stations within a designated polling place. 3 The returning officer for the constituency may make observations on representations made under this section. 4 The Electoral Commission must consider such representations and observations and may, if they think fit\u2014 a direct the relevant authority to make any alterations to the polling places designated by the review which the Commission think necessary in the circumstances; b if the authority fails to make the alterations before the end of the period of two months starting on the day the direction is given, make the alterations themselves. 5 Alterations made by the Electoral Commission under subsection (4) have effect as if they had been made by the relevant authority. 6 An interested authority in relation to a constituency in England and Wales is\u2014 a in England, the council of a parish, or where there is no such council the parish meeting of a parish, which is wholly or partly situated within the constituency; b in Wales, the council of a community which is so situated. 7 The reference in subsection (1)(b) to electors does not include persons who have an anonymous entry in the register of parliamentary electors or local government electors. Sections 18A to 18D: supplemental 18E 1 This section applies for the purposes of sections 18A to 18D. 2 No election is to be questioned by reason of\u2014 a any non-compliance with the provisions of those sections, or b any informality relative to polling districts or polling places. 3 Each of the following is a relevant authority\u2014 a in relation to England, the council of a district or London borough; b in relation to Scotland, a local authority; c in relation to Wales, the council of a county or county borough. 4 The following do not apply to Northern Ireland\u2014 a section 18A(2) to (5); b section 18B(2) to (5); c sections 18C and 18D, and in Northern Ireland the polling districts and polling places are those for the time being established under the law relating to local elections within the meaning of section 130 of the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1962. 2 Before Schedule 1 to that Act (parliamentary elections rules) insert\u2014 SCHEDULE A1 Review of polling districts and polling places Section 18C 1 The relevant authority must publish notice of the holding of a review. 2 The authority must consult the returning officer for every parliamentary election held in a constituency which is wholly or partly in its area. 3 1 Every such returning officer must make representations to the authority. 2 The representations must include information as to the location of polling stations (existing or proposed) within polling places (existing or proposed). 3 The representations must be published in such manner as is prescribed. 4 1 The authority must seek representations from such persons as it thinks have particular expertise in relation to access to premises or facilities for persons who have different forms of disability. 2 Such persons must have an opportunity\u2014 a to make representations; b to comment on the returning officer's representations. 5 Any elector in a constituency situated in whole or in part in the authority's area may make representations. 6 Representations made by any person in connection with a review of polling places may include proposals for specified alternative polling places. 7 On completion of a review the authority must\u2014 a give reasons for its decisions in the review;

Regulated transaction involving unauthorised participant 71I 1 This section applies if a registered party is a party to a regulated transaction in which another participant is not an authorised participant. 2 The transaction is void. 3 Despite subsection (2)\u2014 a any money received by the registered party by virtue of the transaction must be repaid by the treasurer of the party to the person from whom it was received, along with interest at such rate as is determined in accordance with an order made by the Secretary of State; b that person is entitled to recover the money, along with such interest. 4 If\u2014 a the money is not (for whatever reason) repaid as mentioned in subsection (3)(a), or b the person entitled to recover the money refuses or fails to do so, the Commission may apply to the court to make such order as it thinks fit to restore (so far as is possible) the parties to the transaction to the position they would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. 5 An order under subsection (4) may in particular\u2014 a where the transaction is a loan or credit facility, require that any amount owed by the registered party be repaid (and that no further sums be advanced under it); b where any form of security is given for a sum owed under the transaction, require that security to be discharged. 6 In the case of a regulated transaction where a party other than a registered party\u2014 a at the time the registered party enters into the transaction, is an authorised participant, but b subsequently, for whatever reason, ceases to be an authorised participant, the transaction is void and subsections (3) to (5) apply with effect from the time when the other party ceased to be an authorised participant. 7 This section does not apply to a regulated transaction if it was entered into before the commencement of section 61 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006. Guarantees and securities: unauthorised participants 71J 1 This section applies if\u2014 a a registered party and another person (A) enter into a transaction of a description mentioned in section 71F(4)(a), b A is party to a regulated transaction of a description mentioned in section 71F(4)(b)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(\u201cthe connected transaction\u201d) with another person (B), and c B is not an authorised participant. 2 Section 71I(2) to (5) applies to the transaction mentioned in subsection (1)(a). 3 The connected transaction is void. 4 Subsection (5) applies if (but only if) A is unable to recover from the party the whole of the money mentioned in section 71I(3)(a)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(as applied by subsection (2) above), along with such interest as is there mentioned. 5 Despite subsection (3), A is entitled to recover from B any part of that money (and such interest) that is not recovered from the party. 6 Subsection (5) does not entitle A to recover more than the contingent liability under the security provided by virtue of the connected transaction. 7 In the case of a connected transaction where B\u2014 a at the time A enters into the transaction, is an authorised participant, but b subsequently, for whatever reason, ceases to be an authorised participant, subsections (2) to (6) apply with effect from the time when B ceased to be an authorised participant. 8 This section does not apply to a regulated transaction if it was entered into before the commencement of section 61 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006. 9 If the transaction mentioned in section 71F(4)(a) is not a regulated transaction of a description mentioned in section 71F(2) or (3), references in this section and section 71I(2) to (5)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(as applied by subsection (2) above) to the repayment or recovery of money must be construed as references to (as the case may be)\u2014 a the return or recovery of any property provided under the transaction, b to the extent that such property is incapable of being returned or recovered or its market value has diminished since the time the transaction was entered into, the repayment or recovery of the market value at that time, or c the market value (at that time) of any facilities or services provided under the transaction. Transfer to unauthorised participant invalid 71K If an authorised participant purports to transfer his interest in a regulated transaction to a person who is not an authorised participant the purported transfer is of no effect.

he fails to take all reasonable steps to pay to any person who has provided the party with any benefit in consequence of the connected transaction the value of the benefit. 9 A person commits an offence if he\u2014 a knowingly enters into, or b knowingly does any act in furtherance of, any arrangement which facilitates or is likely to facilitate, whether by means of concealment or disguise or otherwise, the participation by a registered party in a regulated transaction with a person other than an authorised participant. 10 It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (2) to prove that he took all reasonable steps to prevent the registered party entering the transaction. 11 It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (6) to prove that he took all reasonable steps to prevent the registered party benefiting in consequence of the connected transaction. 12 A reference to a registered party entering into a regulated

the transaction. 13 A reference to a registered party entering into a transaction in which another participant is not an authorised participant includes a reference to any circumstances in which

before the commencement of section 61 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006. Quarterly reports of regulated transactions 71M 1 The treasurer of a registered party must, in the case of each year, prepare a report under this subsection in respect of each of the following periods\u2014 a January to March; b April to June; c July to September; d October to December. 2 The reports prepared under subsection (1) for any year must, in the case of each authorised participant who enters into or is party to a regulated transaction with the party in that year, comply with\u2014 a the following provisions of this section so far as they require any such transaction to be recorded in such a report; b section 71N so far as it requires any changes in relation to any such transaction to be so recorded. 3 In this section\u2014 \u201c transaction report \u201d means a report prepared under subsection (1); \u201c reporting period \u201d, in relation to such a report, means the period mentioned in any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of that subsection to which the report relates; \u201c relevant transaction \u201d, in relation to an authorised participant and a year, means a regulated transaction entered into by the participant and the registered party in that year; \u201c relevant benefit \u201d, in relation to any person and any year, means\u2014 a relevant donation within the meaning of section 62(3) accepted by the party from that person as a donor, or a relevant transaction entered into by the party and that person as a participant, and a relevant benefit accrues when it is accepted (if it is a donation) or entered into (if it is a transaction). 4 Where no previous relevant benefit or benefits has or have been required to be recorded under this subsection or section 62(4), a relevant transaction must be recorded\u2014 a if the value of the transaction is more than \u00a35,000, or b if the aggregate amount of it and any other relevant benefit or benefits is more than \u00a35,000. 5 A transaction to which subsection (4) applies must\u2014 a if it falls within paragraph (a) of that subsection, be recorded in the transaction report for the reporting period in which the transaction is entered into, or b if it falls within paragraph (b) of that subsection, be recorded (together with any other relevant transaction or transactions included in the aggregate amount mentioned in that paragraph) in the transaction report for the reporting period in which the benefit which causes that aggregate to be more than \u00a35,000 accrues. 6 Where any previous relevant benefit or benefits has or have been required to be recorded under subsection (4) or section 62(4), a relevant transaction must be recorded at the point when a relevant transaction falling within subsection (7) has been entered into\u2014 a since the benefit or benefits required to be recorded under that provision, or b if any relevant benefit or benefits has or have previously been required to be recorded under this subsection or section 62(6), since the benefit or benefits last required to be so recorded. 7 A relevant transaction falls within this subsection\u2014 a if the value of the transaction is more than \u00a31,000, or b if, when it is added to any other relevant benefit or benefits accruing since the time mentioned in subsection (6)(a) or (b), the aggregate amount of the benefits is more than \u00a31,000. 8 A transaction to which subsection (6) applies on any occasion must\u2014 a if it is the only benefit required to be recorded on that occasion, be recorded in the transaction report for the reporting period in which it is entered into, or b in any other case, be recorded (together with any other relevant transaction or transactions included in the aggregate amount mentioned in subsection (7)) in the transaction report for the reporting period in which the benefit which causes that aggregate amount to be more than \u00a31,000 accrues. 9 A transaction report must also record any regulated transaction which is entered into by the party and a person who is not an authorised participant and is dealt with during the reporting period in accordance with section 71I or 71J. 10 If during any reporting period no transactions have been entered into by the party which, by virtue of the preceding provisions of this section, are required to be recorded in the transaction report for that period, the report must contain a statement to that effect. 11 Where a registered party is a party with accounting units, subsections (2) to (10) apply separately in relation to the central organisation of the party and each of its accounting units\u2014 a as if any reference to the party were a reference to the central organisation or (as the case may be) to such an accounting unit; but b with the substitution, in relation to such an accounting unit, of  \u201c                                    \u00a31,000                                  \u201d  for  \u201c\u00a35,000\u201d in each place where it occurs in subsections (4) and (5). 12 However, for the purposes of subsections (2) to (9) in their application to the central organisation and any year by virtue of subsection (11), any transaction\u2014 a which is entered into by an authorised participant and any of the accounting units during that year, but b which is not required to be recorded under subsection (4) or (6)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(as they apply by virtue of subsection (11)) as a transaction entered into by the accounting unit, must be treated as a transaction entered into by the authorised participant and the central organisation. 13 Schedule 6A has effect with respect to the information to be given in transaction reports. Changes to be recorded in quarterly reports 71N 1 If during any reporting period, in the case of any recorded transaction\u2014 a another authorised participant becomes party to the transaction (whether in place of or in addition to any existing participant), b there is any change in the details given in relation to the transaction in pursuance of paragraph 5, 6 or 7 of Schedule 6A, or c the transaction comes to an end, the change must be recorded in the transaction report for that period. 2 For the purposes of subsection (1)(c), a loan comes to an end if\u2014 a the whole debt (or all the remaining debt) is repaid; b the creditor releases the whole debt (or all the remaining debt); and in such a case the transaction report must state how the loan has come to an end. 3 A transaction report must also record any change by which a person who is not an authorised participant becomes party to the transaction (whether in place of or in addition to any existing participant) and in consequence of which the transaction is dealt with in accordance with section 71I or 71J. 4 If during any reporting period there have been no changes (as mentioned in subsection (1) or (3)) to any recorded transaction, the report must contain a statement to that effect. 5 A recorded transaction, in relation to a reporting period, is a regulated transaction which is or has been recorded in a transaction report for that or a previous reporting period. 6 Where a registered party is a party with accounting units, subsections (1) to (5) apply separately in relation to the central organisation of the party and each of its accounting units; and the reference in subsection (5) to a transaction report for a previous reporting period is a reference to a report prepared in relation the central organisation or accounting unit, as the case may be. 7 In this section,  \u201c reporting period \u201d and  \u201c transaction report \u201d have the meanings given in section 71M. Existing transactions 71O 1 This section applies in relation to the first report prepared under section 71M(1) by the treasurer of a party which, at the date on which that section comes into force, is a registered party. 2 Sections 71M and 71N have effect, in the case of a person (whether or not an authorised participant) who is a party to an existing transaction, as if\u2014 a that transaction had been entered into in the reporting period to which the report relates; b any change (as mentioned in section 71N(1) or (3)) to the transaction had occurred during that period; c references in section 71M to a relevant benefit did not include references to a relevant donation. 3 An existing transaction is a regulated transaction which, at the date on which section 71M comes into force, has not come to an end for the purposes of section 71N(1)(c). Exemption from requirement to prepare quarterly reports 71P 1 This section applies if each of four consecutive transaction reports prepared by the treasurer of a registered party in pursuance of subsection (1) of section 71M contains\u2014 a in the case of a party without accounting units, a statement under subsection (10) of that section and a statement under subsection (4) of section 71N, or b in the case of a party with accounting units, statements under each of those subsections in relation to the central organisation of the party and each of its accounting units. 2 The treasurer is not required to prepare any further transaction reports in pursuance of subsection (1) of section 71M until\u2014 a a recordable transaction is entered into by the registered party, or b a recordable change is made to a recorded transaction. 3 A recordable transaction is a transaction which is required to be recorded by virtue of any of subsections (4) to (9) of section 71M (including those subsections as applied by subsection (11) of that section). 4 A recordable change is a change which is required to be recorded by virtue of subsection (1) of section 71N (including that subsection as applied by subsection (6) of that section). 5 If a recordable transaction is entered into or a recordable change is made, nothing in this section affects the operation of section 71M or 71N in relation to\u2014 a the reporting period in which the recordable transaction is entered into or the recordable change is made, or b any subsequent reporting period which falls before the time (if any) when this section again applies in relation to the party. 6 In this section\u2014 \u201c transaction report \u201d and  \u201c reporting period \u201d have the same meaning as in section 71M; \u201c recorded transaction \u201d has the same meaning as in section 71N. Weekly transaction reports during general election periods 71Q 1 Subject to section 71R, the treasurer of a registered party must, in the case of any general election period, prepare a report under this subsection in respect of each of the following periods\u2014 a the period of seven days beginning with the first day of the general election period, b each succeeding period of seven days falling within the general election period, and c any final period of less than seven days falling within that period. 2 In this section\u2014 \u201c weekly report \u201d means a report prepared under subsection (1); \u201c reporting period \u201d, in relation to such a report, means the period mentioned in any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of that subsection to which the report relates. 3 The weekly report for any reporting period must record each regulated transaction which has a value of more than \u00a35,000 entered into during that period\u2014 a by the party (if it is not a party with accounting units), or b by the central organisation of the party (if it is a party with accounting units). 4 If during any reporting period no transactions falling within subsection (3) have been entered into as mentioned in that subsection, the weekly report for that period must contain a statement to that effect. 5 Schedule 6A has effect with respect to the information to be given in weekly reports. 6 The weekly report for any reporting period must also record any change (as mentioned in section 71N(1) or (3)) during that period to a regulated transaction recorded\u2014 a by the party (if it is not a party with accounting units), or b by the central organisation of the party (if it is a party with accounting units). 7 For the purposes of subsection (6), a transaction is recorded by a party or the central organisation of a party if it is or has been recorded in\u2014 a a transaction report prepared under section 71M(1), or b a weekly report prepared for that or a previous reporting period falling within the general election period. 8 If during any reporting period there have been no changes falling within subsection (6), the weekly report for that period must contain a statement to that effect. 9 In this section and section 71R  \u201c general election period \u201d has the meaning given in section 63. Exemptions from section 71Q 71R 1 Section 71Q(1) does not apply in relation to a registered party in respect of a general election period if the party has made an exemption declaration under section 64 which covers the general election in question. 2 In its application (in accordance with subsection (1)) in relation to section 71Q, section 64 is to be read subject to the following modifications\u2014 a the reference in subsection (5) to section 63 is to be read as a reference to section 71Q; b subsection (6) is omitted. Submission of transaction reports to Commission 71S 1 A transaction report under section 71M must be delivered to the Commission by the treasurer of the party in question within the period of 30 days beginning with the end of the reporting period to which it relates. 2 A transaction report under section 71Q must be delivered to the Commission by the treasurer of the party in question\u2014 a within the period of 7 days beginning with the end of the reporting period to which it relates, or b if that is not possible in the case of any party to which section 71Q applies by virtue of section 64(5)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(as applied by section 71R), within the period of 7 days beginning with the first day on which the party has a candidate at the election in question. 3 If a transaction report under section 71M or 71Q states that the registered party has seen evidence of such description as is prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations that an individual participant has an anonymous entry in the electoral register (within the meaning of the Representation of the People Act 1983), the report must be accompanied by a copy of the evidence. 4 The treasurer of a registered party commits an offence if he fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (1) or (2) in relation to a transaction report. 5 The treasurer of a registered party also commits an offence if he delivers a transaction report to the Commission which does not comply with any requirements of this Part as regards the recording of transactions, or changes to transactions, in such a report. 6 Where a person is charged with an offence under this section, it shall be a defence to prove that he took all reasonable steps, and exercised all due diligence, to ensure that any such requirements were complied with in relation to transactions entered into by the party, or changes to transactions made, during the relevant reporting period. 7 Where the court is satisfied, on an application made by the Commission, that any failure to comply with any such requirements in relation to\u2014 a any transaction entered into by a registered party, or b any change made to a transaction to which the registered party is a party, was attributable to an intention on the part of any person to conceal the existence or true value of the transaction, the court may make such order as it thinks fit to restore (so far as is possible) the parties to the transaction to the position they would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. 8 An order under subsection (7) may in particular\u2014 a where the transaction is a loan or credit facility, require that any amount owed by the registered party be repaid (and that no further sums be advanced under it); b where any form of security is given for a sum owed under the transaction, or the transaction is an arrangement by which any form of security is given, require that the security be discharged. 9 The reference in subsection (2) to a party having a candidate at an election must be construed in accordance with section 64(9). Declaration by treasurer in transaction report 71T 1 Each transaction report under section 71M or 71Q must, when delivered to the Commission, be accompanied by a declaration made by the treasurer which complies with subsection (2), (3) or (4). 2 In the case of a report under section 71M (other than one making a nil return), the declaration must state that, to the best of the treasurer's knowledge and belief\u2014 a all the transactions recorded in the report were entered into by the party with authorised participants, b during the reporting period no transaction has been entered into by the party which is required to be recorded in the report but is not so recorded, c during the reporting period no change has been made to a regulated transaction which is required to be recorded in the report but is not so recorded, and d during the reporting period the party has not entered into any regulated transaction with a person or body other than an authorised participant. 3 For the purposes of subsection (2) a return under section 71M makes a nil return if it contains such a statement as is mentioned in subsection (10) of that section and a statement as is mentioned in subsection (4) of section 71N; and in the case of such a report the declaration must state that, to the best of the treasurer's knowledge and belief\u2014 a those statements are accurate, and b during the reporting period the party has not entered into any regulated transaction with a person or body other than an authorised participant. 4 In the case of a report under section 71Q, the declaration must state that, to the best of the treasurer's knowledge and belief\u2014 a no transaction has been entered into by the party, or (if section 71Q(3)(b) applies) by its central organisation, during the reporting period which is required to be recorded in the report but is not so recorded, and b no change has been made to a regulated transaction during the reporting period which is required to be recorded in the report but is not so recorded. 5 A person commits an offence if he knowingly or recklessly makes a false declaration under this section. Weekly donation reports in connection with elections other than general elections 71U 1 The Secretary of State may, after consulting the Commission and all registered parties, by order make provision for\u2014 a sections 71Q and 71R, together with Schedule 6A, b sections 71S and 71T, and c section 147 so far as applying in relation to section 71S(1) or (2), to apply in relation to the specified election period in the case of one or more relevant elections with such modifications as are specified in the order. 2 In this section  \u201c specified election period \u201d and  \u201c relevant election \u201d have the meanings given in section 67. Register of recordable transactions 71V 1 The Commission must maintain a register of all transactions (and all changes) reported to them under this Part. 2 The register must be maintained by the Commission in such form as they may determine and must contain the following details in the case of each such transaction\u2014 a the value of the transaction; b (subject to subsection (3)) such other details as have been given in relation to the transaction in pursuance of any of paragraphs 2 to 7 of Schedule 6A; c the relevant date for the transaction within the meaning of paragraph 8 of that Schedule. 3 The details required by virtue of subsection (2) do not include, in the case of any transaction entered into by an authorised participant who is an individual, the individual's address. 4 Where\u2014 a any transaction or transactions is or are reported to the Commission under this Part, or b any change or changes is or are so reported to them, they must cause the details mentioned in subsection (2) to be entered or, as the case may be, changed in the register in respect of the transaction or transactions as soon as is reasonably practicable.
