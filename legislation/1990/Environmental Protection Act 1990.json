collected by it is the amount of the expenditure which the authority would, if it had had to collect the waste, have incurred in collecting it . 8 The Secretary of State shall, by regulations, make provision for the determination of the net saving of expenditure for the purposes of   subsections (1)(b), (2)(b), (3)(b), (4)(b)   and (5) above. 8A The Secretary of State may give guidance\u2014 a to a waste disposal authority in England, for the purposes of determining whether to exercise the power in subsection (3) above; b to a waste collection authority in England, for the purposes of determining whether to exercise the power in subsection (4) above. 9 A waste disposal authority shall be entitled to receive from a waste collection authority such sums as are needed to reimburse the waste disposal authority the reasonable cost of making arrangements under section 51(1) above for the disposal of commercial and industrial waste collected in the area of the waste disposal authority.

pursuance of a direction under section 51(4)(a) above, to a place which is unreasonably far from the waste collection authority\u2019s area. 11 Any question arising under subsection (9) or (10) above shall, in default of agreement between the two authorities in question, be determined by arbitration. 12 In this section, references to recycling waste include re-using it (whether or not the waste is
