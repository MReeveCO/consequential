" Determination of applications to develop land without compliance with conditions previously attached.", "section_text": "73 1 This section applies, subject to subsection (4), to applications for planning permission for the development of land without complying with conditions subject to which a previous planning permission was granted. 2 On such an application the local planning authority shall consider only the question of the conditions subject to which planning permission should be granted, and\u2014 a if they decide that planning permission should be granted subject to conditions differing from those subject to which the previous permission was granted, or that it should be granted unconditionally, they shall grant planning permission accordingly, and b if they decide that planning permission should be granted subject to the same conditions as those subject to which the previous permission was granted, they shall refuse the application. 2A See also section 100ZA, which makes provision about restrictions on the power to impose conditions under subsection (2) on a grant of planning permission in relation to land in England. 2B Nothing in this section authorises the disapplication of the condition under paragraph 13 of Schedule 7A (biodiversity gain condition). 2C Subsection (2D) applies where\u2014 a for the purposes of paragraph 13 of Schedule 7A a biodiversity gain plan was approved in relation to the previous planning permission (\u201cthe earlier biodiversity gain plan\u201d), b planning permission is granted under this section, and c the conditions

not change the effect of the development on the biodiversity of that onsite habitat (including any arrangements made to compensate for any such effect) as specified in the earlier biodiversity gain plan. 2D Where this subsection applies, the earlier biodiversity gain plan is regarded as approved for the purposes of paragraph 13 of Schedule 7A in relation to the planning permission granted under this section. 2E Nothing in this section authorises the disapplication of the condition under section 90B (condition relating to development progress reports in England). 3 Special provision may be made with respect to such applications\u2014 a by regulations under section 62 as regards the form and content of the application, and b by a development order as regards the procedure to be followed in connection with the application. 4 This section does not apply if the previous planning permission was granted subject to a condition as to the time within which the development to which it related

used for particular purposes. 5 No provision contained in, or having effect under, any enactment, being a provision prohibiting or restricting the use of footpaths, footways or bridleways shall affect

on the highway in relation to which the order was made which was extinguished by virtue of the order under that subsection shall be reinstated. 7 Such an order as is mentioned in subsection (6) may make provision requiring the removal of any obstruction of a highway resulting from the exercise of powers under Part VIIA of the  Highways Act 1980  or sections 1 to 9 of the Business and Planning Act 2020 . 8 Before making an application under subsection (2)  , (2A)  or (6) the local planning authority shall consult with the highway authority (if different) and any other authority who are a

inquiry or other hearing under paragraph 8(1)(a) of Schedule 7; c the consideration of objections under paragraph 8(1)(b) of that Schedule. 1B Where a local planning authority cause a qualifying procedure to be carried out or held, the   appropriate authority is\u2014 a the Secretary of State if the local planning authority causing the procedure to be carried out or held is in England; b the National Assembly for Wales if the local planning authority causing the procedure to be carried out or held is in Wales. 1C Where the qualifying procedure is an independent examination of a strategic development plan under section 64 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, the appropriate authority is the Welsh Ministers. 2 The   appropriate authority    may require the whole or any part of the costs borne by   it   in relation to the qualifying   procedure   to be paid by the local planning authority    or corporate joint committee   causing the qualifying   procedure   to be held. 3 The   appropriate authority    may cause the amount of any such costs to be certified; and any amount so certified and required by   it   to be paid by a local planning authority    or corporate joint committee   shall be recoverable from that authority    or committee   as a civil debt. 4 What may be recovered under this section by the   appropriate authority    is the entire administrative cost of, or incidental to, the qualifying   procedure  , so far as borne by   it  , including, in particular, such reasonable amount or element as   it   may determine in respect of the general staff costs and overheads of his department. 5 For the purposes of subsection (4), the   appropriate authority    may by regulations prescribe a standard daily amount in relation to any description of qualifying   procedure   and any description of person appointed to hold it,  . . .   and where, in relation to a qualifying   procedure   of that description, a person of that description is or has been so appointed, what may be recovered in respect of that qualifying   procedure   by virtue of the appointment of that person  . . .  is\u2014 a the prescribed standard amount from time to time applicable in the case of that qualifying   procedure   and that person in respect of each day, or an appropriate proportion of that amount in respect of a part of a day, on which that person is engaged in the holding of, or is otherwise engaged on work connected with, the qualifying   procedure  ; b any costs actually incurred on travelling or subsistence allowances payable to that person in connection with the qualifying   procedure  ; c any costs attributable to the appointment of an assessor to assist that person  . . .  and d any other costs attributable to the appointment of that person. 6 The cost of, or incidental to, a qualifying   procedure  which does not take place may be recovered by the   appropriate authority    from the local planning authority    or corporate joint committee   from which it would have been recoverable, had the qualifying   procedure   taken place, to the same extent, and in the same way, as the cost of, or incidental to, a qualifying   procedure   which does take place. 7 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

the Secretary of State holds an independent examination in relation to a document prepared by the local planning authority, or by the Secretary of State under section 27(2)(a) of that Act. 10 In this
