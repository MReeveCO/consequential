preference under paragraph 3 of Schedule 27, they shall, in making the statement, comply with section 316(3). 5 A local education authority may, in relation to their mainstream schools taken as a whole, rely on the exception in section 316(3)(b) only if they show that there are no reasonable steps that they could take to prevent the incompatibility. 6 An authority in relation to a particular mainstream school may rely on the exception in section 316(3)(b) only if it shows that there are no reasonable steps that it or another authority in relation to the school could take to prevent the incompatibility. 7 The exception in section 316(3)(b) does not permit a governing body to fail to comply with the duty imposed by section 324(5)(b). 8 An authority must have regard to guidance about
