[{"act": "Criminal Finances Act 2017", "year": 2017, "section": "1", "section_title": "Unexplained wealth orders: England and Wales and Northern Ireland", "section_text": "1 In Chapter 2 of Part 8 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (investigations: England and Wales and Northern Ireland), after section 362 insert\u2014 Unexplained wealth orders Unexplained wealth orders 362A 1 The High Court may, on an application made by an enforcement authority, make an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property if the court is satisfied that each of the requirements for the making of the order is fulfilled. 2 An application for an order must\u2014 a specify or describe the property in respect of which the order is sought, and b specify the person whom the enforcement authority thinks holds the property (\u201c the respondent \u201d)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(and the person specified may include a person outside the United Kingdom). 3 An unexplained wealth order is an order requiring the respondent to provide a statement\u2014 a setting out the nature and extent of the respondent's interest in the property in respect of which the order is made, b explaining how the respondent obtained the property (including, in particular, how any costs incurred in obtaining it were met), c where the property is held by the trustees of a settlement, setting out such details of the settlement as may be specified in the order, and d setting out such other information in connection with the property as may be so specified. 4 The order must specify\u2014 a the form and manner in which the statement is to be given, b the person to whom it is to be given, and c the place at which it is to be given or, if it is to be given in writing, the address to which it is to be sent. 5 The order may, in connection with requiring the respondent to provide the statement mentioned in subsection (3), also require the respondent to produce documents of a kind specified or described in the order. 6 The respondent must comply with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order within whatever period the court may specify (and different periods may be specified in relation to different requirements). 7 In this Chapter  \u201c enforcement authority \u201d means\u2014 a the National Crime Agency, b Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, c the Financial Conduct Authority, d the Director of the Serious Fraud Office, or e the Director of Public Prosecutions (in relation to England and Wales) or the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland (in relation to Northern Ireland). Requirements for making of unexplained wealth order 362B 1 These are the requirements for the making of an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property. 2 The High Court must be satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that\u2014 a the respondent holds the property, and b the value of the property is greater than \u00a350,000. 3 The High Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the known sources of the respondent's lawfully obtained income would have been insufficient for the purposes of enabling the respondent to obtain the property. 4 The High Court must be satisfied that\u2014 a the respondent is a politically exposed person, or b there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\u2014 i the respondent is, or has been, involved in serious crime (whether in a part of the United Kingdom or elsewhere), or ii a person connected with the respondent is, or has been, so involved. 5 It does not matter for the purposes of subsection (2)(a)\u2014 a whether or not there are other persons who also hold the property; b whether the property was obtained by the respondent before or after the coming into force of this section. 6 For the purposes of subsection (3)\u2014 a regard is to be had to any mortgage, charge or other kind of security that it is reasonable to assume was or may have been available to the respondent for the purposes of obtaining the property; b it is to be assumed that the respondent obtained the property for a price equivalent to its market value; c income is  \u201clawfully obtained\u201d if it is obtained lawfully under the laws of the country from where the income arises; d \u201cknown\u201d sources of the respondent's income are the sources of income (whether arising from employment, assets or otherwise) that are reasonably ascertainable from available information at the time of the making of the application for the order; e where the property is an interest in other property comprised in a settlement, the reference to the respondent obtaining the property is to be taken as if it were a reference to the respondent obtaining direct ownership of such share in the settled property as relates to, or is fairly represented by, that interest. 7 In subsection (4)(a),  \u201c politically exposed person \u201d means a person who is\u2014 a an individual who is, or has been, entrusted with prominent public functions by an international organisation or by a State other than  the United Kingdom or another EEA State, i the United Kingdom, or ii an EEA state,   b a family member of a person within paragraph (a), c known to be a close associate of a person within that paragraph, or d otherwise connected with a person within that paragraph. 8 Article 3 of  Directive 2015/849/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 applies for the purposes of determining\u2014 a whether a person has been entrusted with prominent public functions (see point (9) of that Article), b whether a person is a family member (see point (10) of that Article), and c whether a person is known to be a close associate of another (see point (11) of that Article). 9 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a a person is involved in serious crime in a part of the United Kingdom or elsewhere if the person would be so involved for the purposes of Part 1 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 (see in particular sections 2, 2A and 3 of that Act); b section 1122 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (\u201cconnected\u201d persons) applies in determining whether a person is connected with another. 10 Where the property in respect of which the order is sought comprises more than one item of property, the reference in subsection (2)(b) to the value of the property is to the total value of those items. Effect of order: cases of non-compliance 362C 1 This section applies in a case where the respondent fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property before the end of the response period. 2 The property is to be presumed to be recoverable property for the purposes of any proceedings taken in respect of the property under Part 5, unless the contrary is shown. 3 The presumption in subsection (2) applies in relation to property\u2014 a only so far as relating to the respondent's interest in the property, and b only if the value of that interest is greater than the sum specified in section 362B(2)(b). It is for the court hearing the proceedings under Part 5 in relation to which reliance is placed on the presumption to determine the matters in this subsection. 4 The  \u201cresponse period\u201d is whatever period the court specifies under section 362A(6) as the period within which the requirements imposed by the order are to be complied with (or the period ending the latest, if more than one is specified in respect of different requirements). 5 For the purposes of subsection (1)\u2014 a a respondent who purports to comply with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order is not to be taken to have failed to comply with the order (see instead section 362D); b where an unexplained wealth order imposes more than one requirement on the respondent, the respondent is to be taken to have failed to comply with the requirements imposed by the order unless each of the requirements is complied with or is purported to be complied with. 6 Subsections (7) and (8) apply in determining the respondent's interest for the purposes of subsection (3) in a case where the respondent to the unexplained wealth order\u2014 a is connected with another person who is, or has been, involved in serious crime (see subsection (4)(b)(ii) of section 362B), or b is a politically exposed person of a kind mentioned in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of subsection (7) of that section (family member, known close associates  etc  of individual entrusted with prominent public functions). 7 In a case within subsection (6)(a), the respondent's interest is to be taken to include any interest in the property of the person involved in serious crime with whom the respondent is connected. 8 In a case within subsection (6)(b), the respondent's interest is to be taken to include any interest in the property of the person mentioned in subsection (7)(a) of section 362B. 9 Where an unexplained wealth order is made in respect of property comprising more than one item of property, the reference in subsection (3)(b) to the value of the respondent's interest in the property is to the total value of the respondent's interest in those items. Effect of order: cases of compliance or purported compliance 362D 1 This section applies in a case where, before the end of the response period (as defined by section 362C(4)), the respondent complies, or purports to comply, with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property in relation to which the order is made. 2 If an interim freezing order has effect in relation to the property (see section 362J), the enforcement authority must determine what enforcement or investigatory proceedings, if any, it considers ought to be taken in relation to the property. 3 A determination under subsection (2) must be made within the period of 60 days starting with the day of compliance. 4 If the determination under subsection (2) is that no further enforcement or investigatory proceedings ought to be taken in relation to the property, the enforcement authority must notify the High Court of that fact as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event before the end of the 60 day period mentioned in subsection (3)). 5 If there is no interim freezing order in effect in relation to the property, the enforcement authority may (at any time) determine what, if any, enforcement or investigatory proceedings it considers ought to be taken in relation to the property. 6 A determination under this section to take no further enforcement or investigatory proceedings in relation to any property does not prevent such proceedings being taken subsequently (whether as a result of new information or otherwise, and whether or not by the same enforcement authority) in relation to the property. 7 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a the respondent complies with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order only if all of the requirements are complied with, b references to the day of compliance are to the day on which the requirements imposed by the order are complied with (or, if the requirements are complied with over more than one day, the last of those days), and c where an order requires the sending of information in writing to, or the production of documents at, an address specified in the order, compliance with the order (so far as relating to that requirement) occurs when the written information is received, or the documents are produced, at that address, and in paragraphs (a) to (c) references to compliance include purported compliance. 8 In this section  \u201c enforcement or investigatory proceedings \u201d means any proceedings in relation to property taken under\u2014 a Part 2 or 4 (confiscation proceedings in England and Wales or Northern Ireland)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(in relation to cases where the enforcement authority is also a prosecuting authority for the purposes of that Part), b Part 5 (civil recovery of the proceeds of unlawful conduct), or c this Chapter. Offence 362E 1 A person commits an offence if, in purported compliance with a requirement imposed by an unexplained wealth order, the person\u2014 a makes a statement that the person knows to be false or misleading in a material particular, or b recklessly makes a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular. 2 A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable\u2014 a on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or to a fine, or to both; b on summary conviction in England and Wales, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to a fine, or to both; c on summary conviction in Northern Ireland, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both. 3 In relation to an offence committed before the coming into force of section 282 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (increase in maximum sentence on summary conviction of offence triable either way), the reference in subsection (2)(b) to 12 months is to be read as a reference to 6 months. Statements 362F 1 A statement made by a person in response to a requirement imposed by an unexplained wealth order may not be used in evidence against that person in criminal proceedings. 2 Subsection (1) does not apply\u2014 a in the case of proceedings under Part 2 or 4, b on a prosecution for an offence under section 362E, c on a prosecution for an offence under section 5 of the Perjury Act 1911 or Article 10 of the Perjury (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 ( S.I.  1979/1714 (N.I. 19))\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(false statements), or d on a prosecution for some other offence where, in giving evidence, the person makes a statement inconsistent with the statement mentioned in subsection (1). 3 A statement may not be used by virtue of subsection (2)(d) against a person unless\u2014 a evidence relating to it is adduced, or b a question relating to it is asked, by the person or on the person's behalf in proceedings arising out of the prosecution. Disclosure of information, copying of documents, etc 362G 1 An unexplained wealth order has effect in spite of any restriction on the disclosure of information (however imposed). 2 But subsections (1) to (5) of section 361 (rights in connection with privileged information, questions and material) apply in relation to requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order as they apply in relation to requirements imposed under a disclosure order. 3 The enforcement authority may take copies of any documents produced by the respondent in connection with complying with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order. 4 Documents so produced may also be retained for so long as it is necessary to retain them (as opposed to a copy of them) in connection with an investigation of a kind mentioned in section 341 in relation to the property in respect of which the unexplained wealth order is made. 5 But if the enforcement authority has reasonable grounds to believe that the documents\u2014 a may need to be produced for the purposes of any legal proceedings, and b might otherwise be unavailable for those purposes, they may be retained until the proceedings are concluded. Holding of property: trusts and company arrangements etc 362H 1 This section applies for the purposes of sections 362A and 362B. 2 The cases in which a person (P) is to be taken to  \u201chold\u201d property include those where\u2014 a P has effective control over the property; b P is the trustee of a settlement in which the property is comprised; c P is a beneficiary (whether actual or potential) in relation to such a settlement. 3 A person is to be taken to have  \u201ceffective control\u201d over property if, from all the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the person\u2014 a exercises, b is able to exercise, or c is entitled to acquire, direct or indirect control over the property. 4 Where a person holds property by virtue of subsection (2) references to the person obtaining the property are to be read accordingly. 5 References to a person who holds or obtains property include any body corporate, whether incorporated or formed under the law of a part of the United Kingdom or in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom. 6 For further provision about how to construe references to the holding of property, see section 414. Supplementary 362I 1 An application for an unexplained wealth order may be made without notice. 2 Rules of court may make provision as to the practice and procedure to be followed in connection with proceedings relating to unexplained wealth orders before the High Court in Northern Ireland. 3 An application to the High Court in Northern Ireland to discharge or vary an unexplained wealth order may be made by\u2014 a the enforcement authority, or b the respondent. 4 The High Court in Northern Ireland\u2014 a may discharge the order; b may vary the order."}, {"act": "Criminal Finances Act 2017", "year": 2017, "section": "2", "section_title": "Interim freezing orders", "section_text": "2 After section 362I of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (inserted by section 1 above) insert\u2014 Unexplained wealth orders: interim freezing of property Application for interim freezing order 362J 1 This section applies where the High Court makes an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property. 2 The court may make an interim freezing order in respect of the property if the court considers it necessary to do so for the purposes of avoiding the risk of any recovery order that might subsequently be obtained being frustrated. 3 An interim freezing order is an order that prohibits the respondent to the unexplained wealth order, and any other person with an interest in the property, from in any way dealing with the property (subject to any exclusions under section 362L). 4 An interim freezing order\u2014 a may be made only on the application of the enforcement authority that applied for the unexplained wealth order to which the interim freezing order relates, b must be made in the same proceedings as those in which the unexplained wealth order is made, and c may be combined in one document with the unexplained wealth order. 5 If an application for an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property is made without notice, an application for an interim freezing order in respect of the property must also be made without notice. Variation and discharge of interim freezing order 362K 1 The High Court may at any time vary or discharge an interim freezing order. 2 The High Court must discharge an interim freezing order, so far as it has effect in relation to any property, in each of the following three cases. 3 The first case is where\u2014 a the applicable 48 hour period has ended, and b a relevant application has not been made before the end of that period in relation to the property concerned. 4 The second case is where\u2014 a a relevant application has been made before the end of the applicable 48 hour period in relation to the property concerned, and b proceedings on the application (including any on appeal) have been determined or otherwise disposed of. 5 The third case is where the court has received a notification in relation to the property concerned under section 362D(4)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(notification from enforcement authority of no further proceedings). 6 The  \u201capplicable 48 hour period\u201d is to be read as follows\u2014 a in a case where the respondent complies, or purports to comply, with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order before the end of the response period, it is the period of 48 hours beginning with the day after the day with which the 60 day period mentioned in section 362D(3) ends; b in any other case, it is the period of 48 hours beginning with the day after the day with which the response period ends. 7 In calculating a period of 48 hours for the purposes of subsection (6), no account is to be taken of\u2014 a any Saturday or Sunday, b Christmas Day, c Good Friday, or d any day that is a bank holiday under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 in the part of the United Kingdom in which the interim freezing order concerned is made. 8 Section 362D(7) applies for the purposes of subsection (6) in determining whether a person complies, or purports to comply, with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order and when such compliance, or purported compliance, takes place. 9 Before exercising power under this section to vary or discharge an interim freezing order, the court must (as well as giving the parties to the proceedings an opportunity to be heard) give such an opportunity to any person who may be affected by its decision. 10 Subsection (9) does not apply where the court is acting as required by subsection (2). 11 In this section\u2014 \u201c relevant application \u201d means an application for\u2014 a restraint order under section 41 or 190, a property freezing order, or an interim receiving order; \u201c response period \u201d has the meaning given by section 362C(4). Exclusions 362L 1 The power to vary an interim freezing order includes (amongst other things) power to make exclusions as follows\u2014 a power to exclude property from the order, and b power, otherwise than by excluding property from the order, to make exclusions from the prohibition on dealing with the property to which the order applies. 2 Exclusions from the prohibition on dealing with the property to which the order applies (other than exclusions of property from the order) may also be made when the order is made. 3 An exclusion may (amongst other things) make provision for the purpose of enabling any person\u2014 a to meet the person's reasonable living expenses, or b to carry on any trade, business, profession or occupation. 4 An exclusion may be made subject to conditions. 5 Where the court exercises the power to make an exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet legal expenses that the person has incurred, or may incur, in respect of proceedings under this Chapter, it must ensure that the exclusion\u2014 a is limited to reasonable legal expenses that the person has reasonably incurred or reasonably incurs, b specifies the total amount that may be released for legal expenses in pursuance of the exclusion, and c is made subject to the same conditions as would be the required conditions (see section 286A) if the order had been made under section 245A (in addition to any conditions under subsection (4)). 6 The court, in deciding whether to make an exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet legal expenses in respect of proceedings under this Chapter\u2014 a must have regard to the desirability of the person being represented in any proceedings under this Chapter in which the person is a participant, and b must disregard the possibility that legal representation of the person in any such proceedings might, were an exclusion not made, be made available under arrangements made for the purposes of Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 or funded by the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission. 7 If excluded property is not specified in the order it must be described in the order in general terms. Restrictions on proceedings and remedies 362M 1 While an interim freezing order has effect\u2014 a the High Court may stay any action, execution or other legal process in respect of the property to which the order applies, and b no distress may be levied, and no power to use the procedure in Schedule 12 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (taking control of goods) may be exercised, against the property to which the order applies except with the leave of the High Court and subject to any terms the court may impose. 2 If a court (whether the High Court or any other court) in which proceedings are pending in respect of any property is satisfied that an interim freezing order has been applied for or made in respect of the property, it may\u2014 a stay the proceedings, or b allow them to continue on any terms it thinks fit. 3 If an interim freezing order applies to a tenancy of any premises, a right of forfeiture in relation to the premises is exercisable\u2014 a only with the leave of the High Court, and b subject to any terms that the court may impose. 4 The reference in subsection (3) to a  \u201c right of forfeiture \u201d in relation to premises is to the right of a landlord or other person to whom rent is payable to exercise a right of forfeiture by peaceable re-entry to the premises in respect of any failure by the tenant to comply with a term or condition of the tenancy. 5 Before exercising a power conferred by this section, the court must (as well as giving the parties to any proceedings concerned an opportunity to be heard) give such an opportunity to any person who may be affected by the court's decision. Receivers in connection with interim freezing orders 362N 1 This section applies where the High Court makes an interim freezing order on an application by an enforcement authority. 2 The court may, on an application by the enforcement authority, by order appoint a receiver in respect of any property to which the interim freezing order applies. 3 An application under subsection (2) may be made at the same time as the application for the interim freezing order or at any time afterwards. 4 The application may be made without notice if the circumstances of the case are such that notice of the application would prejudice the right of the enforcement authority to obtain a recovery order in respect of any property. 5 In its application the enforcement authority must nominate a suitably qualified person for appointment as a receiver. 6 The person nominated may be a member of staff of the enforcement authority. 7 The enforcement authority may apply a sum received by it under section 280(2) in making payment of the remuneration and expenses of a receiver appointed under this section. 8 Subsection (7) does not apply in relation to the remuneration of the receiver if that person is a member of staff of the enforcement authority (but it does apply in relation to such remuneration if the receiver is a person providing services under arrangements made by the enforcement authority). Powers of receivers appointed under section 362N 362O 1 If the High Court appoints a receiver under section 362N on an application by an enforcement authority, the court may act under this section on the application of the authority. 2 The court may by order authorise or require the receiver\u2014 a to exercise any of the powers mentioned in paragraph 5 of Schedule 6 (management powers) in relation to any property in respect of which the receiver is appointed; b to take any other steps the court thinks appropriate in connection with the management of any such property (including securing the detention, custody or preservation of the property in order to manage it). 3 The court may by order require any person in respect of whose property the receiver is appointed\u2014 a to bring the property to a place (in England and Wales or, as the case may be, Northern Ireland) specified by the receiver or to place it in the custody of the receiver (if in either case the person is able to do so); b to do anything the person is reasonably required to do by the receiver for the preservation of the property. 4 The court may by order require any person in respect of whose property the receiver is appointed to bring any documents relating to the property which are in that person's possession or control to a place (in England and Wales or, as the case may be, Northern Ireland) specified by the receiver or to place them in the custody of the receiver. 5 Any prohibition on dealing with property imposed by an interim freezing order does not prevent a person from complying with any requirements imposed by virtue of this section. 6 Subsection (7) applies in a case where\u2014 a the receiver deals with property that is not property in respect of which the receiver was appointed under section 362N, but b at the time of dealing with the property the receiver believed on reasonable grounds that he or she was entitled to do so by virtue of the appointment. 7 The receiver is not liable to any person in respect of any loss or damage resulting from the receiver's dealing with the property. 8 But subsection (7) does not apply to the extent that the loss or damage is caused by the receiver's negligence. Supervision of section 362N receiver and variations 362P 1 Any of the following persons may at any time apply to the High Court for directions as to the exercise of the functions of a receiver appointed under section 362N\u2014 a the receiver; b a party to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver or the interim freezing order concerned; c a person affected by an action taken by the receiver; d a person who may be affected by an action proposed to be taken by the receiver. 2 Before it gives directions under subsection (1) the court must give an opportunity to be heard to\u2014 a the receiver; b the parties to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver and for the interim freezing order concerned; c a person who may be interested in the application under subsection (1). 3 The court may at any time vary or discharge\u2014 a the appointment of a receiver under section 362N, b an order under section 362O, or c directions under this section. 4 Before exercising a power under subsection (3) the court must give an opportunity to be heard to\u2014 a the receiver; b the parties to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver, for the order under section 362O or (as the case may be) for the directions under this section; c the parties to the proceedings for the interim freezing order concerned; d any person who may be affected by the court's decision. Registration 362Q Sections 248 (registration: England and Wales) and 249 (registration: Northern Ireland) apply in relation to interim freezing orders as they apply in relation to property freezing orders under section 245A.

Requirements for making of unexplained wealth order 396B 1 These are the requirements for the making of an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property. 2 The Court of Session must be satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that\u2014 a the respondent holds the property, and b the value of the property is greater than \u00a350,000. 3 The Court of Session must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the known sources of the respondent's lawfully obtained income would have been insufficient for the purposes of enabling the respondent to obtain the property. 4 The Court of Session must be satisfied that\u2014 a the respondent is a politically exposed person, or b there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\u2014 i the respondent is, or has been, involved in serious crime (whether in a part of the United Kingdom or elsewhere), or ii a person connected with the respondent is, or has been, so involved. 5 It does not matter for the purposes of subsection (2)(a)\u2014 a whether or not there are other persons who also hold the property; b whether the property was obtained by the respondent before or after the coming into force of this section. 6 For the purposes of subsection (3)\u2014 a regard is to be had to any heritable security, charge or other kind of security that it is reasonable to assume was or may have been available to the respondent for the purposes of obtaining the property; b it is to be assumed that the respondent obtained the property for a price equivalent to its market value; c income is  \u201clawfully obtained\u201d if it is obtained lawfully under the laws of the country from where the income arises; d \u201cknown\u201d sources of the respondent's income are the sources of income (whether arising from employment, assets or otherwise) that are reasonably ascertainable from available information at the time of the making of the application for the order; e where the property is an interest in other property comprised in a settlement, the reference to the respondent obtaining the property is to be taken as if it were a reference to the respondent obtaining direct ownership of such share in the settled property as relates to, or is fairly represented by, that interest. 7 In subsection (4)(a),  \u201c politically exposed person \u201d means a person who is\u2014 a an individual who is, or has been, entrusted with prominent public functions by an international organisation or by a State other than the United Kingdom or another  EEA  State, b a family member of a person within paragraph (a), c known to be a close associate of a person within that paragraph, or d otherwise connected with a person within that paragraph. 8 Article 3 of  Directive 2015/849/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 applies for the purposes of determining\u2014 a whether a person has been entrusted with prominent public functions (see point (9) of that Article), b whether a person is a family member (see point (10) of that Article), and c whether a person is known to be a close associate of another (see point (11) of that Article). 9 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a a person is involved in serious crime in a part of the United Kingdom or elsewhere if the person would be so involved for the purposes of Part 1 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 (see in particular sections 2, 2A and 3 of that Act); b section 1122 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (\u201cconnected\u201d persons) applies in determining whether a person is connected with another. 10 Where the property in respect of which the order is sought comprises more than one item of property, the reference in subsection (2)(b) to the value of the property is to the total value of those items. Effect of order: cases of non-compliance 396C 1 This section applies in a case where the respondent fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property before the end of the response period. 2 The property is to be presumed to be recoverable property for the purposes of any proceedings taken in respect of the property under Part 5, unless the contrary is shown. 3 The presumption in subsection (2) applies in relation to property\u2014 a only so far as relating to the respondent's interest in the property, and b only if the value of that interest is greater than the sum specified in section 396B(2)(b). It is for the court hearing the proceedings under Part 5 in relation to which reliance is placed on the presumption to determine the matters in this subsection. 4 The  \u201cresponse period\u201d is whatever period the court specifies under section 396A(6) as the period within which the requirements imposed by the order are to be complied with (or the period ending the latest, if more than one is specified in respect of different requirements). 5 For the purposes of subsection (1)\u2014 a a respondent who purports to comply with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order is not to be taken to have failed to comply with the order (see instead section 396D); b where an unexplained wealth order imposes more than one requirement on the respondent, the respondent is to be taken to have failed to comply with the requirements imposed by the order unless each of the requirements is complied with or is purported to be complied with. 6 Subsections (7) and (8) apply in determining the respondent's interest for the purposes of subsection (3) in a case where the respondent to the unexplained wealth order\u2014 a is connected with another person who is, or has been, involved in serious crime (see subsection (4)(b)(ii) of section 396B), or b is a politically exposed person of a kind mentioned in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of subsection (7) of that section (family member, known close associates etc of individual entrusted with prominent public functions). 7 In a case within subsection (6)(a), the respondent's interest is to be taken to include any interest in the property of the person involved in serious crime with whom the respondent is connected. 8 In a case within subsection (6)(b), the respondent's interest is to be taken to include any interest in the property of the person mentioned in subsection (7)(a) of section 396B. 9 Where an unexplained wealth order is made in respect of property comprising more than one item of property, the reference in subsection (3)(b) to the value of the respondent's interest in the property is to the total value of the respondent's interest in those items. Effect of order: cases of compliance or purported compliance 396D 1 This section applies in a case where the respondent complies, or purports to comply, with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property in relation to which the order is made before the end of the response period (as defined by section 396C(4)). 2 If an interim freezing order has effect in relation to the property (see section 396J), the Scottish Ministers must\u2014 a consider whether the Lord Advocate should be given an opportunity to determine what enforcement or investigatory proceedings, if any, the Lord Advocate considers ought to be taken by the Lord Advocate in relation to the property, and b determine whether they consider that any proceedings under Part 5 (civil recovery of the proceeds of unlawful conduct) or this Chapter ought to be taken by them in relation to the property. 3 If the Scottish Ministers consider that the Lord Advocate should be given an opportunity to make a determination as mentioned in subsection (2)(a), the Lord Advocate must determine what enforcement or investigatory proceedings, if any, the Lord Advocate considers ought to be taken by the Lord Advocate in relation to the property. 4 A determination under subsection (2)(b) or (3) must be made within the period of 60 days starting with the day of compliance. 5 If the determinations under subsections (2)(b) and (3) are that no further proceedings under Part 5 or this Chapter and no further enforcement or investigatory proceedings ought to be taken in relation to the property, the Scottish Ministers must notify the Court of Session of the nature of the determinations as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event before the end of the 60 day period mentioned in subsection (4)). 6 If there is no interim freezing order in effect in relation to the property\u2014 a the Scottish Ministers may (at any time) determine whether they consider that any proceedings under Part 5 or this Chapter ought to be taken by them in relation to the property, and b the Lord Advocate may (at any time) determine what, if any, enforcement or investigatory proceedings the Lord Advocate considers ought to be taken by the Lord Advocate in relation to the property. 7 A determination under this section to take no further proceedings under Part 5 or this Chapter or no further enforcement or investigatory proceedings in relation to any property does not prevent any such proceedings being taken subsequently (whether as a result of new information or otherwise) in relation to the property. 8 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a the respondent complies with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order only if all of the requirements are complied with, b references to the day of compliance are to the day on which the requirements imposed by the order are complied with (or, if the requirements are complied with over more than one day, the last of those days), and c where an order requires the sending of information in writing to, or the production of documents at, an address specified in the order, compliance with the order (so far as relating to that requirement) occurs when the written information is received, or the documents are produced, at that address, and in paragraphs (a) to (c) references to compliance include purported compliance. 9 In this section  \u201c enforcement or investigatory proceedings \u201d means any proceedings in relation to property taken under\u2014 a Part 3 (confiscation proceedings in Scotland), or b this Chapter. Offence 396E 1 A person commits an offence if, in purported compliance with a requirement imposed by an unexplained wealth order, the person\u2014 a makes a statement that the person knows to be false or misleading in a material particular, or b recklessly makes a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular. 2 A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable\u2014 a on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both, or b on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or to a fine, or to both. Statements 396F 1 A statement made by a person in response to a requirement imposed by an unexplained wealth order may not be used in evidence against that person in criminal proceedings. 2 Subsection (1) does not apply\u2014 a in the case of proceedings under Part 3, b on a prosecution for an offence under section 396E, c on a prosecution for perjury, or d on a prosecution for some other offence where, in giving evidence, the person makes a statement inconsistent with the statement mentioned in subsection (1). 3 A statement may not be used by virtue of subsection (2)(d) against a person unless\u2014 a evidence relating to it is adduced, or b a question relating to it is asked, by the person or on the person's behalf in proceedings arising out of the prosecution. Disclosure of information, copying of documents, etc 396G 1 An unexplained wealth order does not confer the right to require a person to answer any question, provide any information or produce any document which the person would be entitled to refuse to answer, provide or produce on grounds of legal privilege. 2 An unexplained wealth order has effect in spite of any restriction on the disclosure of information (however imposed). 3 The Scottish Ministers may take copies of any documents produced by the respondent in connection with complying with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order. 4 Documents so produced may also be retained for so long as it is necessary to retain them (as opposed to a copy of them) in connection with an investigation of a kind mentioned in section 341 in relation to the property in respect of which the unexplained wealth order is made. 5 But if the Scottish Ministers have reasonable grounds to believe that the documents\u2014 a may need to be produced for the purposes of any legal proceedings, and b might otherwise be unavailable for those purposes, they may be retained until the proceedings are concluded. Holding of property: trusts and company arrangements etc 396H 1 This section applies for the purposes of sections 396A and 396B. 2 The cases in which a person (P) is to be taken to  \u201chold\u201d property include those where\u2014 a P has effective control over the property; b P is the trustee of a settlement in which the property is comprised; c P is a beneficiary (whether actual or potential) in relation to such a settlement. 3 A person is to be taken to have  \u201ceffective control\u201d over property if, from all the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the person\u2014 a exercises, b is able to exercise, or c is entitled to acquire, direct or indirect control over the property. 4 Where a person holds property by virtue of subsection (2) references to the person obtaining the property are to be read accordingly. 5 References to a person who holds or obtains property include any body corporate, whether incorporated or formed under the law of a part of the United Kingdom or in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom. 6 For further provision about how to construe references to the holding of property, see section 414. Supplementary 396I 1 An application for an unexplained wealth order may be made without notice. 2 Provision may be made by rules of court as to the discharge and variation of unexplained wealth orders. 3 An application to discharge or vary an unexplained wealth order may be made to the Court of Session by\u2014 a the Scottish Ministers, or b any person affected by the order. 4 The Court of Session may\u2014 a discharge the order; b vary the order."}, {"act": "Criminal Finances Act 2017", "year": 2017, "section": "5", "section_title": "Interim freezing orders", "section_text": "5 After section 396I of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (inserted by section 4 above) insert\u2014 Unexplained wealth orders: interim freezing of property Application for interim freezing order 396J 1 This section applies where the Court of Session makes an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property. 2 The court may make an interim freezing order in respect of the property if the court considers it necessary to do so for the purposes of avoiding the risk of any recovery order that might subsequently be obtained being frustrated. 3 An interim freezing order is an order that prohibits the respondent to the unexplained wealth order, and any other person with an interest in the property, from in any way dealing with the property (subject to any exclusions under section 396L). 4 An interim freezing order\u2014 a may be made only on the application of the Scottish Ministers, b must be made in the same proceedings as those in which the unexplained wealth order is made, and c may be combined in one document with the unexplained wealth order. 5 If an application for an unexplained wealth order in respect of any property is made without notice, an application for an interim freezing order in respect of the property must also be made without notice. Variation and recall of interim freezing order 396K 1 The Court of Session may at any time vary or recall an interim freezing order. 2 The Court of Session must recall an interim freezing order, so far as it has effect in relation to any property, in each of the following three cases. 3 The first case is where\u2014 a the applicable 48 hour period has ended, and b a relevant application has not been made before the end of that period in relation to the property concerned. 4 The second case is where\u2014 a a relevant application has been made before the end of the applicable 48 hour period in relation to the property concerned, and b proceedings on the application (including any on appeal) have been determined or otherwise disposed of. 5 The third case is where the court has received a notification in relation to the property concerned under section 396D(5)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(notification of no further proceedings). 6 References in this section to the  \u201capplicable 48 hour period\u201d are to be read as follows\u2014 a in a case where the respondent complies, or purports to comply, with the requirements imposed by the unexplained wealth order before the end of the response period, it is the period of 48 hours beginning with the day after the day with which the 60 day period mentioned in section 396D(4) ends; b in any other case, it is the period of 48 hours beginning with the day after the day on which the response period ends. 7 In calculating a period of 48 hours for the purposes of subsection (6), no account is to be taken of\u2014 a any Saturday or Sunday, b Christmas Day, c Good Friday, or d any other day that is a bank holiday under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 in Scotland. 8 Section 396D(8) applies for the purposes of subsection (6) in determining whether a person complies, or purports to comply, with the requirements imposed by an unexplained wealth order and when such compliance, or purported compliance, takes place. 9 Before exercising power under this section to vary or recall an interim freezing order, the court must (as well as giving the parties to the proceedings an opportunity to be heard) give such an opportunity to any person who may be affected by its decision. 10 Subsection (9) does not apply where the court is acting as required by subsection (2). 11 In this section\u2014 \u201c relevant application \u201d means an application for\u2014 a restraint order under section 120, a prohibitory property order under section 255A, or an interim administration order under section 256; \u201c response period \u201d has the meaning given by section 396C(4). Exclusions 396L 1 The power to vary an interim freezing order includes (amongst other things) power to make exclusions as follows\u2014 a power to exclude property from the order, and b power, otherwise than by excluding property from the order, to make exclusions from the prohibition on dealing with the property to which the order applies. 2 Exclusions from the prohibition on dealing with the property to which the order applies (other than exclusions of property from the order) may also be made when the order is made. 3 An exclusion may (amongst other things) make provision for the purpose of enabling any person\u2014 a to meet the person's reasonable living expenses, or b to carry on any trade, business, profession or occupation. 4 An exclusion may be made subject to conditions. 5 An exclusion may not be made for the purpose of enabling any person to meet any legal expenses in respect of proceedings under this Chapter. 6 If excluded property is not specified in the order it must be described in the order in general terms. Restrictions on proceedings and remedies 396M 1 While an interim freezing order has effect the Court of Session may sist any action, execution or other legal process in respect of the property to which the order applies. 2 If a court (whether the Court of Session or any other court) in which proceedings are pending in respect of any property is satisfied that an interim freezing order has been applied for or made in respect of the property, it may\u2014 a sist the proceedings, or b allow them to continue on any terms it thinks fit. 3 Before exercising a power conferred by this section, the court must (as well as giving the parties to any proceedings concerned an opportunity to be heard) give such an opportunity to any person who may be affected by the court's decision. Arrestment of property affected by interim freezing order 396N 1 On the application of the Scottish Ministers the Court of Session may, in relation to moveable property to which an interim freezing order applies (whether generally or to such of it as is specified in the application), grant warrant for arrestment. 2 An application under subsection (1) may be made at the same time as the application for the interim freezing order or at any time afterwards. 3 A warrant for arrestment may be granted only if the property would be arrestable if the person entitled to it were a debtor. 4 A warrant under subsection (1) has effect as if granted on the dependence of an action for debt at the instance of the Scottish Ministers against the person and may be executed, recalled, loosed or restricted accordingly. 5 An arrestment executed under this section ceases to have effect when, or in so far as, the interim freezing order ceases to apply in respect of the property in relation to which the warrant for arrestment was granted. 6 If an arrestment ceases to have effect to any extent by virtue of subsection (5), the Scottish Ministers must apply to the Court of Session for an order recalling or, as the case may be, restricting the arrestment. Inhibition of property affected by interim freezing order 396O 1 On the application of the Scottish Ministers, the Court of Session may, in relation to the property mentioned in subsection (2), grant warrant for inhibition against any person specified in an interim freezing order. 2 The property is heritable property situated in Scotland to which the interim freezing order applies (whether generally or to such of it as is specified in the application). 3 The warrant for inhibition\u2014 a has effect as if granted on the dependence of an action for debt by the Scottish Ministers against the person and may be executed, recalled, loosed or restricted accordingly, and b has the effect of letters of inhibition and must forthwith be registered by the Scottish Ministers in the register of inhibitions and adjudications. 4 Section 155 of the Titles to Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1868 (effective date of inhibition) applies in relation to an inhibition for which warrant is granted under subsection (1) as it applies to an inhibition by separate letters or contained in a summons. 5 An inhibition executed under this section ceases to have effect when, or in so far as, the interim freezing order ceases to apply in respect of the property in relation to which the warrant for inhibition was granted. 6 If an inhibition ceases to have effect to any extent by virtue of subsection (5), the Scottish Ministers must\u2014 a apply for the recall or, as the case may be, the restriction of the inhibition, and b ensure that the recall or restriction is reflected in the register of inhibitions and adjudications. Receivers in connection with interim freezing orders 396P 1 This section applies where the Court of Session makes an interim freezing order on an application by the Scottish Ministers. 2 The Court of Session may, on an application by the Scottish Ministers, by order appoint a receiver in respect of any property to which the interim freezing order applies. 3 An application under subsection (2) may be made at the same time as the application for the interim freezing order or at any time afterwards. 4 The application may be made without notice if the circumstances of the case are such that notice of the application would prejudice the right of the Scottish Ministers to obtain a recovery order in respect of the property. 5 In their application the Scottish Ministers must nominate a suitably qualified person for appointment as a receiver. 6 The person nominated may be a member of staff of the Scottish Ministers. 7 The Scottish Ministers may apply a sum received by them under section 280(2) in making payment of the remuneration and expenses of a receiver appointed under this section. 8 Subsection (7) does not apply in relation to the remuneration of the receiver if that person is a member of staff of the Scottish Ministers (but it does apply in relation to such remuneration if the receiver is a person providing services under arrangements made by the Scottish Ministers). Powers of receivers appointed under section 396P 396Q 1 If the Court of Session appoints a receiver under section 396P, the court may act under this section on the application of the Scottish Ministers. 2 The court may by order authorise or require the receiver\u2014 a to exercise any of the powers mentioned in paragraph 5 of Schedule 6 (management powers) in relation to any property in respect of which the receiver is appointed; b to take any other steps the court thinks appropriate in connection with the management of any such property (including securing the detention, custody or preservation of the property in order to manage it). 3 The court may by order require any person in respect of whose property the receiver is appointed\u2014 a to bring the property to a place in Scotland specified by the receiver or to place it in the custody of the receiver (if in either case the person is able to do so); b to do anything the person is reasonably required to do by the receiver for the preservation of the property. 4 The court may by order require any person in respect of whose property the receiver is appointed to bring any documents relating to the property which are in that person's possession or control to a place in Scotland specified by the receiver or to place them in the custody of the receiver. 5 In subsection (4)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201c document \u201d means anything in which information of any description is recorded. 6 Any prohibition on dealing with property imposed by an interim freezing order does not prevent a person from complying with any requirements imposed by virtue of this section. 7 Subsection (8) applies in a case where\u2014 a the receiver deals with property that is not property in respect of which the receiver was appointed under section 396P, but b at the time of dealing with the property the receiver believed on reasonable grounds that he or she was entitled to do so by virtue of his or her appointment. 8 The receiver is not liable to any person in respect of any loss or damage resulting from the receiver's dealing with the property. 9 But subsection (8) does not apply to the extent that the loss or damage is caused by the receiver's negligence. Supervision of section 396P receiver and variations 396R 1 Any of the following persons may at any time apply to the Court of Session for directions as to the exercise of the functions of a receiver appointed under section 396P\u2014 a the receiver; b a party to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver or the interim freezing order concerned; c a person affected by an action taken by the receiver; d a person who may be affected by an action proposed to be taken by the receiver. 2 Before it gives directions under subsection (1), the court must give an opportunity to be heard to\u2014 a the receiver; b the parties to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver and for the interim freezing order concerned; c any person who may be interested in the application under subsection (1). 3 The court may at any time vary or recall\u2014 a the appointment of a receiver under section 396P, b an order under section 396Q, or c directions under this section. 4 Before exercising a power under subsection (3) the court must give an opportunity to be heard to\u2014 a the receiver; b the parties to the proceedings for the appointment of the receiver, for the order under section 396Q or (as the case may be) for the directions under this section; c the parties to the proceedings for the interim freezing order concerned; d any person who may be affected by the court's decision.

Further detention of seized property 303L 1 The period for which property seized under section 303J, or any part of that property, may be detained may be extended by an order made\u2014 a in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, by a magistrates' court; b in Scotland, by the sheriff. 2 An order under subsection (1) may not authorise the detention of any property\u2014 a beyond the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the date of the order, and b in the case of any further order under this section, beyond the end of the period of 2 years beginning with the date of the first order. 3 A justice of the peace may also exercise the power of a magistrates' court to make the first order under subsection (1) extending a particular period of detention. 4 An application for an order under subsection (1) may be made\u2014 a in relation to England and Wales and Northern Ireland, by a person specified in subsection (5); b in relation to Scotland, by the Scottish Ministers in connection with their functions under section 303O or by a procurator fiscal. 5 The persons referred to in subsection (4)(a) are\u2014 a the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, b a constable, c an SFO officer, or d an accredited financial investigator who falls within a description specified in an order made for the purposes of this Chapter by the Secretary of State under section 453. 6 The court, sheriff or justice may make the order if satisfied, in relation to the item of property to be further detained, that\u2014 a it is a listed asset, b the value of it is not less than the minimum value, and c condition 1 or condition 2 is met. 7 Subsection (6)(b) does not apply where the application is for a second or subsequent order under this section. 8 Condition 1 is that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the property is recoverable property and that either\u2014 a its continued detention is justified while its derivation is further investigated or consideration is given to bringing (in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) proceedings against any person for an offence with which the property is connected, or b proceedings against any person for an offence with which the property is connected have been started and have not been concluded. 9 Condition 2 is that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the property is intended to be used in unlawful conduct and that either\u2014 a its continued detention is justified while its intended use is further investigated or consideration is given to bringing (in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) proceedings against any person for an offence with which the property is connected, or b proceedings against any person for an offence with which the property is connected have been started and have not been concluded. 10 Where an application for an order under subsection (1) relates to an item of property seized under section 303J(2), the court, sheriff or justice may make the order if satisfied that\u2014 a the item of property is a listed asset, b condition 1 or 2 is met in respect of part of the item, c the value of that part is not less than the minimum value, and d it is not reasonably practicable to detain only that part. 11 Subsection (10)(c) does not apply where the application is for a second or subsequent order under this section. 12 Where an application for an order under subsection (1) is made in respect of two or more items of property that were seized at the same time and by the same person, this section is to apply as if the value of each item was equal to the aggregate value of all of those items. 13 The references in subsection (12) to the value of an item are to be read as including references to the value of part of an item where subsection (10) applies in relation to one or more of the items in respect of which the application under subsection (1) is made. 14 An order under subsection (1) must provide for notice to be given to persons affected by it. Testing and safekeeping of property seized under section 303J 303M 1 A relevant officer may carry out (or arrange for the carrying out of) tests on any item of property seized under section 303J for the purpose of establishing whether it is a listed asset. 2 A relevant officer must arrange for any item of property seized under section 303J to be safely stored throughout the period during which it is detained under this Chapter. Release of detained property 303N 1 This section applies while any property is detained under section 303K or 303L. 2 A magistrates' court or (in Scotland) the sheriff may direct the release of the whole or any part of the property if the following condition is met. 3 The condition is that the court or sheriff is satisfied, on an application by the person from whom the property was seized, that the conditions in section 303K or 303L (as the case may be) for the detention of the property are no longer met in relation to the property to be released. 4 A relevant officer or (in Scotland) a procurator fiscal may, after notifying the magistrates' court, sheriff or justice under whose order property is being detained, release the whole or any part of it if satisfied that the detention of the property to be released is no longer justified. Forfeiture Forfeiture 303O 1 While property is detained under this Chapter, an application for the forfeiture of the whole or any part of it may be made\u2014 a to a magistrates' court by a person specified in subsection (2); b to the sheriff by the Scottish Ministers. 2 The persons referred to in subsection (1)(a) are\u2014 a the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, b a constable, c an SFO officer, or d an accredited financial investigator who falls within a description specified in an order made for the purposes of this Chapter by the Secretary of State under section 453. 3 The court or sheriff may order the forfeiture of the property or any part of it if satisfied that\u2014 a the property is a listed asset, and b what is to be forfeited is recoverable property or intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct. 4 An order under subsection (3) made by a magistrates' court may provide for payment under section 303U of reasonable legal expenses that a person has reasonably incurred, or may reasonably incur, in respect of\u2014 a the proceedings in which the order is made, or b any related proceedings under this Chapter. 5 A sum in respect of a relevant item of expenditure is not payable under section 303U in pursuance of provision under subsection (4) unless\u2014 a the person who applied for the order under subsection (3) agrees to its payment, or b the court has assessed the amount allowed in respect of that item and the sum is paid in respect of the assessed amount. 6 For the purposes of subsection (5)\u2014 a a  \u201crelevant item of expenditure\u201d is an item of expenditure to which regulations under section 286B would apply if the order under subsection (3) had instead been a recovery order; b an amount is  \u201callowed\u201d in respect of a relevant item of expenditure if it would have been allowed by those regulations; c if the person who applied for the order under subsection (3) was a constable, an SFO officer or an accredited financial investigator, that person may not agree to the payment of a sum unless the person is a senior officer or is authorised to do so by a senior officer. 7 \u201cSenior officer\u201d has the same meaning in subsection (6)(c) as it has in section 303E. 8 Subsection (3) ceases to apply on the transfer of an application made under this section in accordance with section 303R(1)(a) or (b). 9 Where an application for the forfeiture of any property is made under this section, the property is to be detained (and may not be released under any power conferred by this Chapter) until any proceedings in pursuance of the application (including any proceedings on appeal) are concluded. 10 Where the property to which the application relates is being detained under this Chapter as part of an item of property, having been seized under section 303J(2), subsection (9) is to be read as if it required the continued detention of the whole of the item of property. Associated and joint property 303P 1 Sections 303Q and 303R apply if\u2014 a an application is made under section 303O in respect of property detained under this Chapter, b the court or sheriff is satisfied that the property is a listed asset, c the court or sheriff is satisfied that all or part of the property is recoverable property or intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct, and d there exists property that is associated with the property in relation to which the court or sheriff is satisfied as mentioned in paragraph (c). 2 Sections 303Q and 303R also apply in England and Wales and Northern Ireland if\u2014 a an application is made under section 303O in respect of property detained under this Chapter, b the court is satisfied that the property is a listed asset, c the court is satisfied that all or part of the property is recoverable property, and d the property in relation to which the court is satisfied as mentioned in paragraph (c) belongs to joint tenants and one of the tenants is an excepted joint owner. 3 In this section and sections 303Q and 303R  \u201c associated property \u201d means property of any of the following descriptions that is not itself the forfeitable property\u2014 a any interest in the forfeitable property; b any other interest in the property in which the forfeitable property subsists; c if the forfeitable property is a tenancy in common, the tenancy of the other tenant; d if (in Scotland) the forfeitable property is owned in common, the interest of the other owner; e if the forfeitable property is part of a larger property, but not a separate part, the remainder of that property. References to property being associated with forfeitable property are to be read accordingly. 4 In this section and sections 303Q and 303R the  \u201c forfeitable property \u201d means the property in relation to which the court or sheriff is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (1)(c) or (2)(c)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(as the case may be). Agreements about associated and joint property 303Q 1 Where\u2014 a this section applies, and b the person who applied for the order under section 303O (on the one hand) and the person who holds the associated property or who is the excepted joint owner (on the other hand) agree, the magistrates' court or sheriff may, instead of making an order under section 303O(3), make an order requiring the person who holds the associated property or who is the excepted joint owner to make a payment to a person identified in the order. 2 The amount of the payment is (subject to subsection (3)) to be the amount which the persons referred to in subsection (1)(b) agree represents\u2014 a in a case where this section applies by virtue of section 303P(1), the value of the forfeitable property; b in a case where this section applies by virtue of section 303P(2), the value of the forfeitable property less the value of the excepted joint owner's share. 3 The amount of the payment may be reduced if the person who applied for the order under section 303O agrees that the other party to the agreement has suffered loss as a result of the seizure of the forfeitable property and any associated property under section 303J and its subsequent detention. 4 The reduction that is permissible by virtue of subsection (3) is such amount as the parties to the agreement agree is reasonable, having regard to the loss suffered and any other relevant circumstances. 5 An order under subsection (1) may, so far as required for giving effect to the agreement, include provision for vesting, creating or extinguishing any interest in property. 6 An order under subsection (1) made by a magistrates' court may provide for payment under subsection (12) of reasonable legal expenses that a person has reasonably incurred, or may reasonably incur, in respect of\u2014 a the proceedings in which the order is made, or b any related proceedings under this Chapter. 7 A sum in respect of a relevant item of expenditure is not payable under subsection (12) in pursuance of provision under subsection (6) unless\u2014 a the person who applied for the order under section 303O agrees to its payment, or b the court has assessed the amount allowed in respect of that item and the sum is paid in respect of the assessed amount. 8 For the purposes of subsection (7)\u2014 a a  \u201crelevant item of expenditure\u201d is an item of expenditure to which regulations under section 286B would apply if the order under subsection (1) had instead been a recovery order; b an amount is  \u201callowed\u201d in respect of a relevant item of expenditure if it would have been allowed by those regulations. 9 For the purposes of section 308(2), on the making of an order under subsection (1), the forfeitable property is to be treated as if it had been forfeited. 10 If there is more than one item of associated property or more than one excepted joint owner, the total amount to be paid under subsection (1), and the part of that amount which is to be provided by each person who holds any such associated property or who is an excepted joint owner, is to be agreed between both (or all) of them and the person who applied for the order under section 303O. 11 If the person who applied for the order under section 303O was a constable, an SFO officer or an accredited financial investigator, that person may enter into an agreement for the purposes of any provision of this section only if the person is a senior officer or is authorised to do so by a senior officer. \u201cSenior officer\u201d has the same meaning in this subsection as it has in section 303E. 12 An amount received under an order under subsection (1) must be applied as follows\u2014 a first, it must be applied in making any payment of legal expenses which, after giving effect to subsection (7), are payable under this subsection in pursuance of provision under subsection (6); b second, it must be applied in payment or reimbursement of any reasonable costs incurred in storing or insuring the forfeitable property and any associated property whilst detained under this Part; c third, it must be paid\u2014 i if the order was made by a magistrates' court, into the Consolidated Fund; ii if the order was made by the sheriff, into the Scottish Consolidated Fund. Associated and joint property: default of agreement 303R 1 Where this section applies and there is no agreement under section 303Q, the magistrates' court or sheriff\u2014 a must transfer the application made under section 303O to the relevant court if satisfied that the value of the forfeitable property and any associated property is \u00a310,000 or more; b may transfer the application made under section 303O to the relevant court if satisfied that the value of the forfeitable property and any associated property is less than \u00a310,000. 2 The  \u201crelevant court\u201d is\u2014 a the High Court, where the application under section 303O was made to a magistrates' court; b the Court of Session, where the application under section 303O was made to the sheriff. 3 Where (under subsection (1)(a) or (b)) an application made under section 303O is transferred to the relevant court, the relevant court may order the forfeiture of the property to which the application relates, or any part of that property, if satisfied that\u2014 a the property is a listed asset, and b what is to be forfeited is recoverable property or intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct. 4 An order under subsection (3) made by the High Court may include provision of the type that may be included in an order under section 303O(3) made by a magistrates' court by virtue of section 303O(4). 5 If provision is included in an order of the High Court by virtue of subsection (4) of this section, section 303O(5) and (6) apply with the necessary modifications. 6 The relevant court may, as well as making an order under subsection (3), make an order\u2014 a providing for the forfeiture of the associated property or (as the case may be) for the excepted joint owner's interest to be extinguished, or b providing for the excepted joint owner's interest to be severed. 7 Where (under subsection (1)(b)) the magistrates' court or sheriff decides not to transfer an application made under section 303O to the relevant court, the magistrates' court or sheriff may, as well as making an order under section 303O(3), make an order\u2014 a providing for the forfeiture of the associated property or (as the case may be) for the excepted joint owner's interest to be extinguished, or b providing for the excepted joint owner's interest to be severed. 8 An order under subsection (6) or (7) may be made only if the relevant court, the magistrates' court or the sheriff (as the case may be) thinks it just and equitable to do so. 9 An order under subsection (6) or (7) must provide for the payment of an amount to the person who holds the associated property or who is an excepted joint owner. 10 In making an order under subsection (6) or (7), and including provision in it by virtue of subsection (9), the relevant court, the magistrates' court or the sheriff (as the case may be) must have regard to\u2014 a the rights of any person who holds the associated property or who is an excepted joint owner and the value to that person of that property or (as the case may) of that person's share (including any value that cannot be assessed in terms of money), and b the interest of the person who applied for the order under section 303O in realising the value of the forfeitable property. 11 If the relevant court, the magistrates' court or the sheriff (as the case may be) is satisfied that\u2014 a the person who holds the associated property or who is an excepted joint owner has suffered loss as a result of the seizure of the forfeitable property and any associated property under section 303J and its subsequent detention, and b the circumstances are exceptional, an order under subsection (6) or (7) may require the payment of compensation to that person. 12 The amount of compensation to be paid by virtue of subsection (11) is the amount the relevant court, the magistrates' court or the sheriff (as the case may be) thinks reasonable, having regard to the loss suffered and any other relevant circumstances. 13 Compensation to be paid by virtue of subsection (11) is to be paid in the same way that compensation is to be paid under section 303W. Sections 303O to 303R: appeals 303S 1 Any party to proceedings for an order for the forfeiture of property under section 303O may appeal against\u2014 a the making of an order under section 303O; b the making of an order under section 303R(7); c a decision not to make an order under section 303O unless the reason that no order was made is that an order was instead made under section 303Q; d a decision not to make an order under section 303R(7). Paragraphs (c) and (d) do not apply if the application for the order under section 303O was transferred in accordance with section 303R(1)(a) or (b). 2 Where an order under section 303Q is made by a magistrates' court, any party to the proceedings for the order (including any party to the proceedings under section 303O that preceded the making of the order) may appeal against a decision to include, or not to include, provision in the order under subsection (6) of section 303Q. 3 An appeal under this section lies\u2014 a in relation to England and Wales, to the Crown Court; b in relation to Scotland, to the Sheriff Appeal Court; c in relation to Northern Ireland, to a county court. 4 An appeal under this section must be made before the end of the period of 30 days starting with the day on which the court makes the order or decision. 5 The court hearing the appeal may make any order it thinks appropriate. 6 If the court upholds an appeal against an order forfeiting property, it may order the release of the whole or any part of the property. Realisation of forfeited property 303T 1 If property is forfeited under section 303O or 303R, a relevant officer must realise the property or make arrangements for its realisation. 2 But the property is not to be realised\u2014 a before the end of the period within which an appeal may be made (whether under section 303S or otherwise), or b if an appeal is made within that period, before the appeal is determined or otherwise disposed of. 3 The realisation of property under subsection (1) must be carried out, so far as practicable, in the manner best calculated to maximise the amount obtained for the property. Proceeds of realisation 303U 1 The proceeds of property realised under section 303T must be applied as follows\u2014 a first, they must be applied in making any payment required to be made by virtue of section 303R(9); b second, they must be applied in making any payment of legal expenses which, after giving effect to section 303O(5)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(including as applied by section 303R(5)), are payable under this subsection in pursuance of provision under section 303O(4) or, as the case may be, 303R(4); c third, they must be applied in payment or reimbursement of any reasonable costs incurred in storing or insuring the property whilst detained under this Part and in realising the property; d fourth, they must be paid\u2014 i if the property was forfeited by a magistrates' court or the High Court, into the Consolidated Fund; ii if the property was forfeited by the sheriff or the Court of Session, into the Scottish Consolidated Fund. 2 If what is realised under section 303T represents part only of an item of property seized under section 303J and detained under this Chapter, the reference in subsection (1)(c) to costs incurred in storing or insuring the property is to be read as a reference to costs incurred in storing or insuring the whole of the item of property. Supplementary Victims and other owners 303V 1 A person who claims that any property detained under this Chapter, or any part of it, belongs to him or her may apply for the property or part to be released. 2 An application under subsection (1) is to be made\u2014 a in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, to a magistrates' court; b in Scotland, to the sheriff. 3 The application may be made in the course of proceedings under section 303L or 303O or at any other time. 4 The court or sheriff may order the property to which the application relates to be released to the applicant if it appears to the court or sheriff that\u2014 a the applicant was deprived of the property to which the application relates, or of property which it represents, by unlawful conduct, b the property the applicant was deprived of was not, immediately before the applicant was deprived of it, recoverable property, and c the property belongs to the applicant. 5 If subsection (6) applies, the court or sheriff may order the property to which the application relates to be released to the applicant or to the person from whom it was seized. 6 This subsection applies where\u2014 a the applicant is not the person from whom the property to which the application relates was seized, b it appears to the court or sheriff that that property belongs to the applicant, c the court or sheriff is satisfied that the release condition is met in relation to that property, and d no objection to the making of an order under subsection (5) has been made by the person from whom that property was seized. 7 The release condition is met\u2014 a in relation to property detained under section 303K or 303L, if the conditions in section 303K or (as the case may be) 303L for the detention of the property are no longer met, and b in relation to property detained under section 303O, if the court or sheriff decides not to make an order under that section in relation to the property.

Powers for prosecutors to appear in proceedings 303X 1 The Director of Public Prosecutions or the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland may appear for a constable or an accredited financial investigator in proceedings under this Chapter if the Director\u2014 a is asked by, or on behalf of, a constable or (as the case may be) an accredited financial investigator to do so, and b considers it appropriate to do so. 2 The Director of Public Prosecutions may appear for the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs or an officer of Revenue and Customs in proceedings under this Chapter if the Director\u2014 a is asked by, or on behalf of, the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs or (as the case may be) an officer of Revenue and Customs to do so, and b considers it appropriate to do so. 3 The Directors may charge fees for the provision of services under this section. 4 The references in subsection (1) to an accredited financial investigator do not include an accredited financial investigator who is an officer of Revenue and Customs but the references in subsection (2) to an officer of Revenue and Customs do include an accredited financial investigator who is an officer of Revenue and Customs. \u201cThe minimum value\u201d 303Y 1 For the purposes of this Chapter,  \u201cthe minimum value\u201d is \u00a31,000. 2 The Secretary of State may by regulations amend the amount for the time being specified in subsection (1). 3 The Secretary of State must consult the Scottish Ministers and the Department of Justice before making regulations under subsection (2). Financial investigators 303Z Where an accredited financial investigator of a particular description\u2014 a applies for an order under section 303L, b applies for forfeiture under section 303O, or c brings an appeal under, or relating to, this Chapter, any subsequent step in the application or appeal, or any further application or appeal relating to the same matter, may be taken, made or brought by a different accredited financial investigator of the same description."}, {"act": "Criminal Finances Act 2017", "year": 2017, "section": "16", "section_title": "Forfeiture of money held in bank and building society accounts", "section_text": "16 In Part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (civil recovery of the proceeds etc of unlawful conduct), after section 303Z (inserted by section 15 above) insert\u2014 CHAPTER 3B Forfeiture of money held in bank and building society accounts Freezing of bank and building society accounts Application for account freezing order 303Z1 1 This section applies if an enforcement officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that money held in an account maintained with a bank or building society\u2014 a is recoverable property, or b is intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct. 2 Where this section applies (but subject to section 303Z2) the enforcement officer may apply to the relevant court for an account freezing order in relation to the account in which the money is held. 3 For the purposes of this Chapter\u2014 a an account freezing order is an order that, subject to any exclusions (see section 303Z5), prohibits each person by or for whom the account to which the order applies is operated from making withdrawals or payments from the account; b an account is operated by or for a person if the person is an account holder or a signatory or identified as a beneficiary in relation to the account. 4 An application for an account freezing order may be made without notice if the circumstances of the case are such that notice of the application would prejudice the taking of any steps under this Chapter to forfeit money that is recoverable property or intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct. 5 The money referred to in subsection (1) may be all or part of the credit balance of the account. 6 In this Chapter\u2014 \u201c bank \u201d has the meaning given by section 303Z7; \u201c building society \u201d has the same meaning as in the Building Societies Act 1986; \u201c enforcement officer \u201d means\u2014 an officer of Revenue and Customs, a constable, an SFO officer, or an accredited financial investigator who falls within a description specified in an order made for the purposes of this Chapter by the Secretary of State under section 453; \u201c the minimum amount \u201d has the meaning given by section 303Z8; \u201crelevant court\u201d\u2014 in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, means a magistrates' court, and in Scotland, means the sheriff.

Making of account freezing order 303Z3 1 This section applies where an application for an account freezing order is made under section 303Z1 in relation to an account. 2 The relevant court may make the order if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that money held in the account (whether all or part of the credit balance of the account)\u2014 a is recoverable property, or b is intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct. 3 An account freezing order ceases to have effect at the end of the period specified in the order (which may be varied under section 303Z4) unless it ceases to have effect at an earlier or later time in accordance with the provision made by sections 303Z9(6)(c), 303Z11(2) to (7), 303Z14(6) to (8) and 303Z15. 4 The period specified by the relevant court for the purposes of subsection (3)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(whether when the order is first made or on a variation under section 303Z4) may not exceed the period of 2 years, starting with the day on which the account freezing order is (or was) made. 5 An account freezing order must provide for notice to be given to persons affected by the order. Variation and setting aside of account freezing order 303Z4 1 The relevant court may at any time vary or set aside an account freezing order on an application made by\u2014 a an enforcement officer, or b any person affected by the order. 2 But an enforcement officer may not make an application under subsection (1) unless the officer is a senior officer or is authorised to do so by a senior officer. 3 Before varying or setting aside an account freezing order the court must (as well as giving the parties to the proceedings an opportunity to be heard) give such an opportunity to any person who may be affected by its decision. 4 In relation to Scotland, the references in this section to setting aside an order are to be read as references to recalling it. Exclusions 303Z5 1 The power to vary an account freezing order includes (amongst other things) power to make exclusions from the prohibition on making withdrawals or payments from the account to which the order applies. 2 Exclusions from the prohibition may also be made when the order is made. 3 An exclusion may (amongst other things) make provision for the purpose of enabling a person by or for whom the account is operated\u2014 a to meet the person's reasonable living expenses, or b to carry on any trade, business, profession or occupation. 4 An exclusion may be made subject to conditions. 5 Where a magistrates' court exercises the power to make an exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet legal expenses that the person has incurred, or may incur, in respect of proceedings under this Part, it must ensure that the exclusion\u2014 a is limited to reasonable legal expenses that the person has reasonably incurred or that the person reasonably incurs, b specifies the total amount that may be released for legal expenses in pursuance of the exclusion, and c is made subject to the same conditions as would be the required conditions (see section 286A) if the order had been made under section 245A (in addition to any conditions imposed under subsection (4)). 6 A magistrates' court, in deciding whether to make an exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet legal expenses in respect of proceedings under this Part\u2014 a must have regard to the desirability of the person being represented in any proceedings under this Part in which the person is a participant, and b must disregard the possibility that legal representation of the person in any such proceedings might, were an exclusion not made\u2014 i be made available under arrangements made for the purposes of Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, or ii be funded by the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission. 7 The sheriff's power to make exclusions may not be exercised for the purpose of enabling any person to meet any legal expenses in respect of proceedings under this Part. 8 The power to make exclusions must, subject to subsection (6), be exercised with a view to ensuring, so far as practicable, that there is not undue prejudice to the taking of any steps under this Chapter to forfeit money that is recoverable property or intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct. Restriction on proceedings and remedies 303Z6 1 If a court in which proceedings are pending in respect of an account maintained with a bank or building society is satisfied that an account freezing order has been applied for or made in respect of the account, it may either stay the proceedings or allow them to continue on any terms it thinks fit. 2 Before exercising the power conferred by subsection (1), the court must (as well as giving the parties to any of the proceedings concerned an opportunity to be heard) give such an opportunity to any person who may be affected by the court's decision. 3 In relation to Scotland, the reference in subsection (1) to staying the proceedings is to be read as a reference to sisting the proceedings. \u201cBank\u201d 303Z7 1 \u201c Bank \u201d means an authorised deposit-taker, other than a building society, that has its head office or a branch in the United Kingdom. 2 In subsection (1),  \u201c authorised deposit-taker \u201d means\u2014 a a person who has permission under Part 4A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to accept deposits; b a person who\u2014 i is specified, or is within a class of persons specified, by an order under section 38 of that Act (exemption orders), and ii accepts deposits; c an EEA firm of the kind mentioned in paragraph 5(b) of Schedule 3 to that Act that has permission under paragraph 15 of that Schedule (as a result of qualifying for authorisation under paragraph 12(1) of that Schedule) to accept deposits. 3 A reference in subsection (2) to a person  or firm  with permission to accept deposits does not include a person  or firm  with permission to do so only for the purposes of, or in the course of, an activity other than accepting deposits. \u201cThe minimum amount\u201d 303Z8 1 \u201cThe minimum amount\u201d is \u00a31,000. 2 The Secretary of State may by regulations amend the amount for the time being specified in subsection (1). 3 The Secretary of State must consult the Scottish Ministers and the Department of Justice before making regulations under subsection (2). 4 For the purposes of this Chapter the amount of any money held in an account maintained with a bank or building society in a currency other than sterling must be taken to be its sterling equivalent, calculated in accordance with the prevailing rate of exchange. Account forfeiture notices (England and Wales and Northern Ireland) Account forfeiture notice 303Z9 1 This section applies while an account freezing order made by a magistrates' court has effect. In this section the account to which the order applies is  \u201cthe frozen account\u201d. 2 A senior officer may give a notice for the purpose of forfeiting money held in the frozen account (whether all or part of the credit balance of the account) if satisfied that the money\u2014 a is recoverable property, or b is intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct. 3 A notice given under subsection (2) is referred to in this Chapter as an account forfeiture notice. 4 An account forfeiture notice must\u2014 a state the amount of money held in the frozen account which it is proposed be forfeited, b confirm that the senior officer is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2), c specify a period for objecting to the proposed forfeiture and an address to which any objections must be sent, and d explain that the money will be forfeited unless an objection is received at that address within the period for objecting. 5 The period for objecting must be at least 30 days starting with the day after the notice is given. 6 If no objection is made within the period for objecting, and the notice has not lapsed under section 303Z11\u2014 a the amount of money stated in the notice is forfeited (subject to section 303Z12), b the bank or building society with which the frozen account is maintained must transfer that amount of money into an interest-bearing account nominated by an enforcement officer, and c immediately after the transfer has been made, the account freezing order made in relation to the frozen account ceases to have effect. 7 An objection may be made by anyone (whether a recipient of the notice or not). 8 An objection means a written objection sent to the address specified in the notice; and an objection is made when it is received at the address. 9 An objection does not prevent forfeiture of the money held in the frozen account under section 303Z14. Giving of account forfeiture notice 303Z10 1 The Secretary of State must make regulations about how an account forfeiture notice is to be given. 2 The regulations may (amongst other things) provide\u2014 a for an account forfeiture notice to be given to such person or persons, and in such manner, as may be prescribed; b for circumstances in which, and the time at which, an account forfeiture notice is to be treated as having been given. 3 The regulations must ensure that where an account forfeiture notice is given it is, if possible, given to every person to whom notice of the account freezing order was given. Lapse of account forfeiture notice 303Z11 1 An account forfeiture notice lapses if\u2014 a an objection is made within the period for objecting specified in the notice under section 303Z9(4)(c), b an application is made under section 303Z14 for the forfeiture of money held in the frozen account, or c an order is made under section 303Z4 setting aside the relevant account freezing order. 2 If an account forfeiture notice lapses under subsection (1)(a), the relevant account freezing order ceases to have effect at the end of the period of 48 hours starting with the making of the objection (\u201cthe 48-hour period\u201d). This is subject to subsections (3) and (7). 3 If within the 48-hour period an application is made\u2014 a for a variation of the relevant account freezing order under section 303Z4 so as to extend the period specified in the order, or b for forfeiture of money held in the frozen account under section 303Z14, the order continues to have effect until the relevant time (and then ceases to have effect). 4 In the case of an application of the kind mentioned in subsection (3)(a), the relevant time means\u2014 a if an extension is granted, the time determined in accordance with section 303Z3(3), or b if an extension is not granted, the time when the application is determined or otherwise disposed of. 5 In the case of an application of the kind mentioned in subsection (3)(b), the relevant time is the time determined in accordance with section 303Z14(6). 6 If within the 48-hour period it is decided that no application of the kind mentioned in subsection (3)(a) or (b) is to be made, an enforcement officer must, as soon as possible, notify the bank or building society with which the frozen account is maintained of that decision. 7 If the bank or building society is notified in accordance with subsection (6) before the expiry of the 48-hour period, the relevant account freezing order ceases to have effect on the bank or building society being so notified. 8 In relation to an account forfeiture notice\u2014 a \u201cthe frozen account\u201d is the account in which the money to which the account forfeiture notice relates is held; b \u201cthe relevant account freezing order\u201d is the account freezing order made in relation to the frozen account. 9 In calculating a period of 48 hours for the purposes of this section no account is to be taken of\u2014 a any Saturday or Sunday, b Christmas Day, c Good Friday, or d any day that is a bank holiday under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 in the part of the United Kingdom in which the account freezing order was made. Application to set aside forfeiture 303Z12 1 A person aggrieved by the forfeiture of money in pursuance of section 303Z9(6)(a) may apply to a magistrates' court for an order setting aside the forfeiture of the money or any part of it. 2 The application must be made before the end of the period of 30 days starting with the day on which the period for objecting ended (\u201cthe 30-day period\u201d). 3 But the court may give permission for an application to be made after the 30-day period has ended if it thinks that there are exceptional circumstances to explain why the applicant\u2014 a failed to object to the forfeiture within the period for objecting, and b failed to make an application within the 30-day period. 4 On an application under this section the court must consider whether the money to which the application relates could be forfeited under section 303Z14 (ignoring the forfeiture mentioned in subsection (1)). 5 If the court is satisfied that the money to which the application relates or any part of it could not be forfeited under that section it must set aside the forfeiture of that money or part. 6 Where the court sets aside the forfeiture of any money\u2014 a it must order the release of that money, and b the money is to be treated as never having been forfeited. 7 Where money is released by virtue of subsection (6)(a), there must be added to the money on its release any interest accrued on it whilst in the account referred to in section 303Z9(6)(b). Application of money forfeited under account forfeiture notice 303Z13 1 Money forfeited in pursuance of section 303Z9(6)(a), and any interest accrued on it whilst in the account referred to in section 303Z9(6)(b), is to be paid into the Consolidated Fund. 2 But it is not to be paid in\u2014 a before the end of the period within which an application under section 303Z12 may be made (ignoring the possibility of an application by virtue of section 303Z12(3)), or b if an application is made within that period, before the application is determined or otherwise disposed of. Forfeiture orders Forfeiture order 303Z14 1 This section applies while an account freezing order has effect. In this section the account to which the account freezing order applies is  \u201cthe frozen account\u201d. 2 An application for the forfeiture of money held in the frozen account (whether all or part of the credit balance of the account) may be made\u2014 a to a magistrates' court by a person specified in subsection (3), or b to the sheriff by the Scottish Ministers. 3 The persons referred to in subsection (2)(a) are\u2014 a the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, b a constable, c an SFO officer, or d an accredited financial investigator who falls within a description specified in an order made for the purposes of this Chapter by the Secretary of State under section 453. 4 The court or sheriff may order the forfeiture of the money or any part of it if satisfied that the money or part\u2014 a is recoverable property, or b is intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct. 5 But in the case of recoverable property which belongs to joint tenants, one of whom is an excepted joint owner, an order by a magistrates' court may not apply to so much of it as the court thinks is attributable to the excepted joint owner's share. 6 Where an application is made under subsection (2), the account freezing order is to continue to have effect until the time referred to in subsection (7)(b) or (8). But subsections (7)(b) and (8) are subject to section 303Z15. 7 Where money held in a frozen account is ordered to be forfeited under subsection (4)\u2014 a the bank or building society with which the frozen account is maintained must transfer that amount of money into an interest-bearing account nominated by an enforcement officer, and b immediately after the transfer has been made the account freezing order made in relation to the frozen account ceases to have effect. 8 Where, other than by the making of an order under subsection (4), an application under subsection (2) is determined or otherwise disposed of, the account freezing order ceases to have effect immediately after that determination or other disposal. Continuation of account freezing order pending appeal 303Z15 1 This section applies where, on an application under subsection (2) of section 303Z14 in relation to an account to which an account freezing order applies, the court or sheriff decides\u2014 a to make an order under subsection (4) of that section in relation to part only of the money to which the application related, or b not to make an order under subsection (4) of that section. 2 The person who made the application under section 303Z14(2) may apply without notice to the court or sheriff that made the decision referred to in subsection (1)(a) or (b) for an order that the account freezing order is to continue to have effect. 3 Where the court or sheriff makes an order under subsection (2) the account freezing order is to continue to have effect until\u2014 a the end of the period of 48 hours starting with the making of the order under subsection (2), or b if within that period of 48 hours an appeal is brought under section 303Z16 against the decision referred to in subsection (1)(a) or (b), the time when the appeal is determined or otherwise disposed of. 4 Subsection (9) of section 303Z11 applies for the purposes of subsection (3) as it applies for the purposes of that section. Appeal against decision under section 303Z14 303Z16 1 Any party to proceedings for an order for the forfeiture of money under section 303Z14 who is aggrieved by an order under that section or by the decision of the court not to make such an order may appeal\u2014 a from an order or decision of a magistrates' court in England and Wales, to the Crown Court; b from an order or decision of the sheriff, to the Sheriff Appeal Court; c from an order or decision of a magistrates' court in Northern Ireland, to a county court. 2 An appeal under subsection (1) must be made before the end of the period of 30 days starting with the day on which the court makes the order or decision. 3 The court hearing the appeal may make any order it thinks appropriate. 4 If the court upholds an appeal against an order forfeiting the money, it may order the release of the whole or any part of the money. 5 Where money is released by virtue of subsection (4), there must be added to the money on its release any interest accrued on it whilst in the account referred to in section 303Z14(7)(a). Application of money forfeited under account forfeiture order 303Z17 1 Money forfeited by an order under section 303Z14, and any interest accrued on it whilst in the account referred to in subsection (7)(a) of that section\u2014 a if forfeited by a magistrates' court, is to be paid into the Consolidated Fund, and b if forfeited by the sheriff, is to be paid into the Scottish Consolidated Fund. 2 But it is not to be paid in\u2014 a before the end of the period within which an appeal under section 303Z16 may be made, or b if a person appeals under that section, before the appeal is determined or otherwise disposed of. Supplementary Compensation 303Z18 1 This section applies if\u2014 a an account freezing order is made, and b none of the money held in the account to which the order applies is forfeited in pursuance of an account forfeiture notice or by an order under section 303Z14. 2 Where this section applies a person by or for whom the account to which the account freezing order applies is operated may make an application to the relevant court for compensation. 3 If the relevant court is satisfied that the applicant has suffered loss as a result of the making of the account freezing order and that the circumstances are exceptional, the relevant court may order compensation to be paid to the applicant. 4 The amount of compensation to be paid is the amount the relevant court thinks reasonable, having regard to the loss suffered and any other relevant circumstances. 5 If the account freezing order was applied for by an officer of Revenue and Customs, the compensation is to be paid by the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. 6 If the account freezing order was applied for by a constable, the compensation is to be paid as follows\u2014 a in the case of a constable of a police force in England and Wales, it is to be paid out of the police fund from which the expenses of the police force are met; b in the case of a constable of the Police Service of Scotland, it is to be paid by the Scottish Police Authority; c in the case of a police officer within the meaning of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, it is to be paid out of money provided by the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. 7 If the account freezing order was applied for by an SFO officer, the compensation is to be paid by the Director of the Serious Fraud Office. 8 If the account freezing order was applied for by a National Crime Agency officer, the compensation is to be paid by the National Crime Agency. 9 If the account freezing order was applied for by an accredited financial investigator who was not an officer of Revenue and Customs, a constable, an SFO officer or a National Crime Agency officer, the compensation is to be paid as follows\u2014 a in the case of an investigator who was\u2014 i a member of the civilian staff of a police force (including the metropolitan police force), within the meaning of Part 1 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, or ii a member of staff of the City of London police force, it is to be paid out of the police fund from which the expenses of the police force are met, b in the case of an investigator who was a member of staff of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, it is to be paid out of money provided by the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, c in the case of an investigator who was a member of staff of a department of the Government of the United Kingdom, it is to be paid by the Minister of the Crown in charge of the department or by the department, d in the case of an investigator who was a member of staff of a Northern Ireland department, it is to be paid by the department, e in the case of an investigator who was exercising a function of the Welsh Revenue Authority, it is to be paid by the Welsh Revenue Authority, and f in any other case, it is to be paid by the employer of the investigator. 10 The Secretary of State may by regulations amend subsection (9). 11 The power in subsection (10) is exercisable by the Department of Justice (and not by the Secretary of State) so far as it may be used to make provision which could be made by an Act of the Northern Ireland Assembly without the consent of the Secretary of State (see sections 6 to 8 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.)

to be disclosed (or each of them, where the disclosure is to more than one person) is also carrying on a business in the regulated sector as a relevant undertaking (whether or not of the same kind as A). 3 Condition 2 is that\u2014 a a constable has requested A to make the disclosure, or b the person to whom the information is to be disclosed (or at least one of them, where the disclosure is to

is that A is satisfied that the disclosure of the information will or may assist in determining any matter in connection with\u2014 a a suspicion that a person is involved in the commission of a

made by a constable. 8 A person may disclose information to A for the purposes of making a disclosure request if, and to the extent that, the person has reason to believe that A has in A's possession information that will or may assist in determining any matter of the kind mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (5). Section 21CA: disclosure requests and notifications 21CB 1 A disclosure request must\u2014 a state that it is made in connection with\u2014 i a suspicion that a person is involved in the commission of a terrorist financing offence, or ii the identification of terrorist property or of its movement or use, b identify the person or property (so far as known), c describe the information that is sought from A, and d specify the person or persons to whom it is requested that the information is disclosed. 2 Subsections (3) and (4) apply where the disclosure request is made by a person mentioned in section 21CA(3)(b). 3 If the request states that it is made in connection with a suspicion that a person is involved in the commission of a terrorist financing offence, the request must also\u2014 a set out the grounds for the suspicion, or b provide such other information as the person making the request thinks appropriate for the purposes of enabling A to determine whether the information requested ought to be disclosed under section 21CA. 4 If the request states that it is made in connection with the identification of terrorist property or of its movement or use, the request must also provide such other information as the person making the request thinks appropriate for the purposes of enabling A to determine whether the information requested ought to be disclosed under section 21CA. 5 A required notification for the purposes of section 21CA(4) must be made\u2014 a in the case of a disclosure request made by a constable, by the person who is to disclose information under section 21CA as a result of the request; b in the case of a disclosure request made by a person mentioned in section 21CA(3)(b), by the person who made the request. 6 In a case within subsection (5)(a), the required notification must state that information is to be disclosed under section 21CA. 7 In a case within subsection (5)(b), the required notification must\u2014 a state that a disclosure request has been made; b specify the person to whom the request was made; c where the disclosure request to which the notification relates is made in connection with a suspicion of a person's involvement in the commission of a terrorist financing offence, identify the person (so far as known); d where the disclosure request to which the notification relates is made in connection with the identification of terrorist property or of its movement or use, identify the property and the person who holds it (if known). 8 A notification for the purposes of condition 5 in subsection (6) of section 21CA must\u2014 a state that a disclosure request is to be made; b specify the person to whom it is to be made; c describe the information to be sought in the request; d explain why the request is being made. Section 21CA: effect on disclosures under section 21A 21CC 1 This section applies if in any proceedings a question arises as to whether the required disclosure has been made\u2014 a by a person (A) who discloses information under section 21CA(1) as a result of a disclosure request, b by a person (B) who makes a required notification in accordance with section 21CB(5)(b), or c by any other person (C) to whom A discloses information under section 21CA(1) as a result of that request. 2 The making of a required notification in good faith is to be treated as satisfying any requirement to make the required disclosure on the part of A, B and C. This is subject to section 21CD(1) to (8). 3 The making of a joint disclosure report in good faith is to be treated as satisfying any requirement to make the required disclosure on the part of the persons who jointly make the report. This is subject to section 21CD(10). 4 A joint disclosure report is a report to a constable that\u2014 a is made jointly by A and B (whether or not also jointly with other persons to whom A discloses information under section 21CA(1)), b satisfies the requirements as to content mentioned in subsection (5) or (as the case may be) subsection (6), c is prepared after the making of a disclosure by A to B under section 21CA(1) in connection with\u2014 i a suspicion of a person's involvement in the commission of a terrorist financing offence, or ii the identification of terrorist property or of its movement or use, and d is sent to the constable before the end of the applicable period. 5 In the case of a joint disclosure report prepared in connection with a suspicion of a person's involvement in the commission of a terrorist financing offence, the requirements as to content are that the report must\u2014 a explain the extent to which there are continuing grounds to suspect that the person is involved in the commission of the offence, b identify the person (if known), c set out the grounds for the suspicion, and d provide any other information relevant to the matter. 6 In the case of a joint disclosure report prepared in connection with the identification of terrorist property or of its movement or use, the requirements as to content are that the report must\u2014 a explain the extent to which there are continuing grounds to suspect that the property is terrorist property, b identify the property and the person who holds it (if known), c provide details of its movement or use (if known), and d provide any other information relevant to the matter. 7 The applicable period is\u2014 a in a case where the disclosure under section 21CA was made as a result of a request from a constable by virtue of subsection (3)(a) of that section, whatever period may be specified by the constable when making the request; b in a case where the disclosure was made as a result of a request from another person by virtue of subsection (3)(b) of that section, the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notification is made for the purposes of condition 3 in section 21CA(4). 8 A constable may vary the period of 28 days (whether by lengthening or shortening it) by giving written notice to the person who made the required notification. 9 A joint disclosure report must be\u2014 a approved by the nominated officer of each person that jointly makes the report, and b signed by the nominated officer on behalf of each such person. If there is no nominated officer the report must be approved and signed by another senior officer. 10 References in this section to A, B or C include\u2014 a a nominated officer acting on behalf of A, B or C, and b any other person who is an employee, officer or partner of A, B or C. Limitations on application of section 21CC(2) and (3) 21CD 1 Subsections (2) and (3) apply in a case where the required notification is made by A (notification made as a result of disclosure request received from a constable). 2 Section 21CC(2) has effect in the case of A, B or C only so far as relating to\u2014 a the suspicion in connection with which the required notification is made, and b matters known, suspected or believed as a result of the making of the disclosure request concerned. 3 Accordingly, section 21CC(2) does not remove any requirement to make the required disclosure in relation to anything known, suspected or believed that does not result only from the making of the disclosure request. 4 Subsections (5) to (8) apply in a case where the required notification is made by B (notification made as a result of disclosure request received from another undertaking in the regulated sector). 5 Section 21CC(2) has effect in the case of A or C only so far as relating to\u2014 a the suspicion in connection with which the notification by B is made, and b matters known, suspected or believed by A or C as a result of the making of that notification. 6 Accordingly, section 21CC(2) does not remove any requirement to make the required disclosure in relation to anything known, suspected or believed that does not result only from the making of the notification. 7 Section 21CC(2) has effect in the case of B only so far as relating to\u2014 a the suspicion in connection with which the notification is made, and b matters known, suspected or believed by B at the time of the making of the notification. 8 If a joint disclosure report is not made before the end of the applicable period (whether the required notification was made by A or B), section 21CC(2)\u2014 a has effect only so far as relating to any requirement to make the required disclosure that would have otherwise arisen within that period, and b does not remove a requirement to make the required disclosure so far as arising after the end of that period on the part of any person in respect of matters that may become known, suspected or believed by the person after the time when the required notification was made. 9 If a joint disclosure report is not made before the end of the applicable period, the person who made the required notification must notify a constable that a report is not being made as soon as reasonably practicable after the period ends. 10 Section 21CC(3) has effect only so far as relating to\u2014 a the suspicion in connection with which the report is made, and b matters known, suspected or believed at the time of the making of the report. 11 Terms used in this section have the same meanings as in section 21CC. Section 21CA: supplementary 21CE 1 A relevant disclosure made in good faith does not breach\u2014 a an obligation of confidence owed by the person making the disclosure, or b any other restriction on the disclosure of information, however imposed. 2 But a relevant disclosure may not include information obtained from a UK law enforcement agency unless that agency consents to the disclosure. 3 In a case where a person is acting on behalf of another (\u201cthe undertaking\u201d) as a nominated officer\u2014 a a relevant disclosure by the undertaking must be made by the nominated officer on behalf of the undertaking, and b a relevant disclosure to the undertaking must be made to that officer. 4 Subsection (1) applies whether or not the conditions in section 21CA were met in respect of the disclosure if the person making the disclosure did so in the reasonable belief that the conditions were met. 5 In this section\u2014 \u201c relevant disclosure \u201d means any disclosure made in compliance, or intended compliance, with section 21CA; \u201c UK law enforcement agency \u201d means\u2014 the National Crime Agency; a police force in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales; any other person operating in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales charged with the duty of preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting offences.
