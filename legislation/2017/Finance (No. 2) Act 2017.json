payment\u201d and  \u201capproved contractual payment\u201d etc) apply for the purposes of subsection (2) as they apply for the purposes of section 309. \u201cPost-employment notice pay\u201d 402D 1 \u201cThe post-employment notice pay\u201d in respect of a termination is (subject to subsection (11)) given by\u2014 ( BP \u00d7 D P ) \u2212 T where\u2014 BP, D and P are given by subsections (3) to (7), and T is the total of the amounts of any payment or benefit received in connection with the termination which\u2014 would fall within section 401(1)(a) but for section 401(3), is taxable as earnings under Chapter 1 of Part 3, is not pay in respect of holiday entitlement for a period before the employment ends, and is not a bonus payable for termination of the employment. 2 If the amount given by the formula in subsection (1) is a negative amount, the post-employment notice pay is nil. 3 Subject to subsections (5) and (6)\u2014 BP is the employee's basic pay (see subsection (7)) from the employment in respect of the last pay period of the employee to end before the trigger date, P is the number of days in that pay period, and D is the number of days in the post-employment notice period. 4 See section 402E for the meaning of  \u201ctrigger date\u201d and  \u201cpost-employment notice period\u201d. 5 If there is no pay period of the employee which ends before the trigger date then\u2014 BP is the employee's basic pay from the employment in respect of the period starting with the first day of the employment and ending with the trigger date, P is the number of days in that period, and D is the number of days in the post-employment notice period. 6 If the last pay period of the employee to end before the trigger date is a month, the minimum notice (see section 402E) is given by contractual terms and is expressed to be a whole number of months, and the post-employment notice period is equal in length to the minimum notice or is otherwise a whole number of months, then\u2014 BP is the employee's basic pay from the employment in respect of the last pay period of the employee to end before the trigger date, P is 1, and D is the length of the post-employment notice period expressed in months. 7 In this section  \u201c basic pay \u201d means\u2014 a employment income of the employee from the employment but disregarding\u2014 i any amount received by way of overtime, bonus, commission, gratuity or allowance, ii any amount received in connection with the termination of the employment, iii any amount treated as earnings under Chapters 2 to 10 of Part 3 (the benefits code) or which would be so treated apart from section 64, iv any amount which is treated as earnings under Chapter 12 of Part 3 (amounts treated as earnings), v any amount which counts as employment income by virtue of Part 7 (income relating to securities and securities options), and vi any employment-related securities that constitute earnings under Chapter 1 of Part 3 (earnings), and b any amount which the employee has given up the right to receive but which would have fallen within paragraph (a) had the employee not done so. 8 In subsection (7)  \u201c employment-related securities \u201d has the same meaning as it has in Chapter 1 of Part 7 (see section 421B). 9 The Treasury may by regulations amend this section for the purpose of altering the meaning of  \u201cbasic pay\u201d. 10 A statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (9) may not be made unless a draft of it has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, the House of Commons. 11 Where the purpose, or one of the purposes, of any arrangements is the avoidance of tax by causing the post-employment notice pay calculated under subsection (1) to be less than it would otherwise be, the post-employment notice pay is to be treated as the amount which the post-employment notice pay would have been but for the arrangements. 12 In subsection (11)  \u201c arrangements \u201d includes any scheme, arrangement or understanding of any kind, whether or not legally enforceable, involving a single transaction or two or more transactions. Meaning of  \u201ctrigger date\u201d and  \u201cpost-employment notice period\u201d in section 402D 402E 1 Subsections (2) and (4) to (6) have effect for the purposes of section 402D (and subsection (4) has effect also for the purposes of this section). 2 The  \u201ctrigger date\u201d is\u2014 a if the termination is not a notice case, the last day of the employment, and b if the termination is a notice case, the day the notice is given. 3 For the purposes of this section, the termination is a  \u201cnotice case\u201d if the employer or employee gives notice to the other to terminate the employment, and here it does not matter\u2014 a whether the notice is more or less than, or the same as, the minimum notice, or b if the employment ends before the notice expires. 4 The  \u201cminimum notice\u201d is the minimum notice required to be given by the employer to terminate the employee's employment by notice in accordance with the law and contractual terms effective\u2014 a where the termination is not a notice case\u2014 i immediately before the employment ends, or ii where the employment ends by agreement entered into after the start of the employment, immediately before the agreement is entered into, and b where the termination is a notice case, immediately before the notice is given. 5 The  \u201cpost-employment notice period\u201d is the period\u2014 a beginning at the end of the last day of the employment, and b ending with the earliest lawful termination date. (But see subsection (8) for provision about limited-term contracts.) 6 If the earliest lawful termination date is, or precedes, the last day of the employment, the number of days in the post-employment notice period is nil. 7 \u201cThe earliest lawful termination date\u201d is the last day of the period which\u2014 a is equal in length to the minimum notice, and b begins at the end of the trigger date. 8 In the case of a contract of employment which is a limited-term contract and which does not include provision for termination by notice by the employer, the post-employment notice period is the period\u2014 a beginning at the end of the last day of the employment, and b ending with the day of the occurrence of the limiting event. 9 If, in a case to which subsection (8) applies, on the last day of the employment the day of the occurrence of the limiting event is not ascertained or ascertainable (because, for example, the limiting event is the performance of a task), then subsection (8) has effect as if for paragraph (b) there were substituted\u2014 b ending with the day on which notice would have expired if the employer had, on the last day of the employment, given to the employee the minimum notice required to terminate the contract under section 86 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (assuming that that section applies to the employment). 10 In this section  \u201c limited-term contract \u201d and  \u201c limiting event \u201d have the same meaning as in the Employment Rights Act 1996 (see section 235(2A) and (2B)). 4 In section 403 (charges on payments and benefits which can benefit from threshold)\u2014 a in subsection (1), for  \u201cChapter\u201d substitute  \u201c                        section                      \u201d , b in

as a deduction in accordance with this section from the company's total profits in calculating the corporation tax chargeable for the accounting period in which the payment is made. 2 The deduction is from the company's total profits for the accounting period after any other relief from corporation tax other than\u2014 a relief under Part 6, b group relief, and c group relief for carried-forward losses. 3 If the company is a qualifying sport body at the time of the payment, a deduction is allowed for the amount of the payment. See section 217C for the meaning of  \u201cqualifying sport body\u201d. 4 If the company is not a qualifying sport body at the time of the payment, a deduction is allowed\u2014 a if the payment is to a qualifying sport body, for the amount of the payment, and b if the payment does not fall within paragraph (a) (a  \u201cdirect payment\u201d), in accordance with subsections (7) and (8). 5 If at any time on or after 1 April 2017 the company receives income for use for charitable purposes which are purposes for facilitating participation in amateur eligible sport, a deduction is allowed only if, and in so far as, the payment exceeds an amount which is equal to the amount of that income which\u2014 a the company does not have to bring into account for corporation tax purposes, and b has not previously been taken into account under this subsection to disallow a deduction under this Part of all or any part of a payment. See section 217B(3) for the meaning of terms used in this subsection. 6 But in any case, the amount of the deduction is limited to the amount that reduces the company's taxable total profits for the accounting period to nil. 7 If the total of all the direct payments made by the company in the accounting period is equal to or less than the maximum deduction for direct payments, a deduction is allowed under subsection (4)(b) in respect of that total. 8 If the total of all the direct payments made by the company in the accounting period is more than the maximum deduction for direct payments, a deduction is allowed under subsection (4)(b) in respect of so much of that total as does not exceed the maximum deduction for direct payments. 9 The maximum deduction for direct payments is \u00a32,500 or, if the accounting period is shorter than 12 months, a proportionately reduced amount. 10 The Treasury may by regulations amend subsection (9) by substituting a higher amount for the amount for the time being specified there. Meaning of qualifying expenditure on grassroots sport 217B 1 For the purposes of this Part, a payment is qualifying expenditure on grassroots sport if\u2014 a it is expenditure incurred for charitable purposes which are purposes for facilitating participation in amateur eligible sport, and b apart from this Part, no deduction from total profits, or in calculating any component of total profits, would be allowed in respect of the payment. For the meaning of charitable purposes, see sections 2, 7 and 8 of the Charities Act 2011. 2 Where expenditure is incurred for both\u2014 a charitable purposes which are purposes for facilitating participation in amateur eligible sport, and b other purposes, then, for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to be apportioned between the purposes in paragraph (a) and the purposes in paragraph (b) on a just and reasonable basis. 3 For the purposes of section 217A(5) and subsection (1)(a)\u2014 a paying a person to play or take part in a sport does not facilitate participation in amateur sport, but paying coaches or officials for their services may do so, and b \u201c eligible sport \u201d means a sport that for the time being is an eligible sport for the purposes of Chapter 9 of Part 13 (see section 661). Meaning of qualifying sport body 217C 1 For the purposes of this Part, a  \u201cqualifying sport body\u201d is\u2014 a a recognised sport governing body; b a body which is wholly owned by a recognised sport governing body. 2 A  \u201crecognised sport governing body\u201d is a body which is included from time to time in a list, maintained by the National Sports Councils, of governing bodies of sport recognised by them. 3 The Treasury may by regulations\u2014 a amend this section for the purpose of altering the meaning of  \u201cqualifying sport body\u201d; b designate bodies to be treated as qualifying sport bodies for the purposes of this Part. 4 Regulations under section (3)(b) may designate a body by reference to its inclusion in a class or description of bodies. 5 In this section  \u201c the National Sports Councils \u201d means\u2014 a the United Kingdom Sports Council, b the English Sports Council, c the Scottish Sports Council, d the Sports Council for Wales, and e the Sports Council for Northern Ireland. 6 Regulations under subsection (3)(b) made before 1 April 2018 may include provision having effect in relation to times before the regulations are made (but not times earlier than 1 April 2017).

\u201crelevant trade\u201d) alone or in partnership. 3 Condition B is that\u2014 a there is an arrangement (\u201cthe arrangement\u201d) in connection with the relevant trade to which T is a party or which otherwise (wholly or partly) covers or relates to T, and b it is reasonable to suppose that, in essence\u2014 i the arrangement, or ii the arrangement so far as it covers or relates to T, is (wholly or partly) a means of providing, or is otherwise concerned with the provision of, relevant benefits. 4 Condition C is that\u2014 a a relevant benefit arises to T, or a person who is or has

connected with T, as a result of the arrangement. 7 For the purposes of subsection (3) in particular, all relevant circumstances are to be taken into account in order to get to the essence of the matter. 8 In this section and sections 23B to 23H,  \u201c this group of sections \u201d means this section and those sections. 9 The provisions of this group of sections apply to professions and vocations as they apply to trades. 10 See Schedule 12 to F(No.2)A 2017 for provision about the application of this group of sections in relation to loans and quasi-loans that are outstanding on 5 April 2019. Meaning of  \u201crelevant benefit\u201d 23B 1 The following provisions apply for the purposes of this group of sections. 2 \u201c Relevant benefit \u201d means any payment (including a payment by way of a loan), a transfer of money's worth, or any other benefit. 3 The assumption of a liability of T by another person is to be treated as the provision of a relevant benefit to T. 4 The assumption, by a person other than T, of a liability of a person (\u201cC\u201d) who is or has been connected with T, is to be treated as the provision of a relevant benefit to C. 5 \u201c Loan \u201d includes\u2014 a any form of credit; b a payment that is purported to be made by way of a loan. Meaning of  \u201cqualifying third party payment\u201d 23C 1 The following provisions apply for the purposes of this group of sections. 2 A payment is a  \u201cthird party payment\u201d if it is made (by T or another person) to\u2014 a T acting as trustee, or b any person other than T. 3 A third party payment is a  \u201cqualifying third party payment\u201d if the deduction condition or the trade connection condition is met in relation to the payment. 4 The  \u201cdeduction condition\u201d is met in relation to a payment if\u2014 a a deduction for the payment is made in calculating the profits of the relevant trade, or b where the relevant trade is or has been carried on in partnership, a deduction for the payment is made in calculating the amount on which T is liable to income tax in respect of the profits of the trade. 5 The  \u201ctrade connection condition\u201d is met in relation to a payment if it is reasonable to suppose that in essence\u2014 a the payment is by way of consideration for goods or services provided in the course of the relevant trade, or b there is some other connection (direct or indirect) between the payment and the provision of goods or services in the course of the relevant trade. 6 For the purposes of subsection (5) in particular, all relevant circumstances are to be taken into account in order to get to the essence of the matter.

Tax treatment of relevant benefits 23E 1 Where this section applies (see section 23A), the relevant benefit amount is to be treated for income tax purposes as profits of the relevant trade for\u2014 a the tax year in which the relevant benefit arises, or b if T has ceased to carry on the relevant trade in a tax year (the  \u201cearlier tax year\u201d) before the tax year referred to in paragraph (a), the earlier tax year. 2 For the purposes of this section,  \u201c the relevant benefit amount \u201d means\u2014 a if the relevant benefit is a payment otherwise than by way of a loan, an amount equal to the amount of the payment, b if the relevant benefit is a payment by way of loan, an amount equal to the principal amount lent, or c in any other case, an amount equal to the value of the relevant benefit. 3 For the purposes of subsection (2)(c), the value of a relevant benefit is\u2014 a its market value at the time it arises, or b if higher, the cost of providing it. 4 In subsection (3)  \u201c market value \u201d has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of TCGA 1992 by virtue of Part 8 of that Act. Relevant benefits: persons other than T 23F 1 For the purposes of section 23A(4), the enjoyment conditions are\u2014 a that the relevant benefit, or part of it, is in fact so dealt with by any person as to be calculated at some time to enure for the benefit of T; b that the arising of the relevant benefit operates to increase the value to T of any assets\u2014 i which T holds, or ii which are held for the benefit of T; c that T receives, or is entitled to receive, at any time any benefit provided or to be provided out of, or deriving or to be derived from, the relevant benefit (or part of it); d where the relevant benefit is the payment of a sum of money (including a payment by way of loan), that T may become entitled to the beneficial enjoyment of the sum or part of the sum if one or more powers are exercised or successively exercised (and for these purposes it does not matter who may exercise the powers or whether they are exercisable with or without the consent of another person); e where the relevant benefit is the payment of a sum of money (including a payment by way of loan), that T is able in any manner to control directly or indirectly the application of the sum or part of the sum. 2 Where an enjoyment condition is met in relation to part only of a relevant benefit, that part is to be treated as a separate benefit for the purposes of section 23A(4). 3 In subsection (1) references to T include references to a person who is or has been connected with T. 4 In determining whether any of the enjoyment conditions is met in relation to a relevant benefit, regard must be had to the substantial result and effect of all the relevant circumstances. Anti-avoidance 23G 1 In determining whether section 23E applies in relation to a relevant benefit, no regard is to be had to any arrangements the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which is to secure that section 23E does not apply in relation to the whole, or any part, of\u2014 a the relevant benefit, or b the relevant benefit and one or more other relevant benefits (whether or not all arising to the same person). 2 Where arrangements are disregarded under subsection (1), and a relevant benefit (or part of it)\u2014 a would, if the arrangements were not disregarded, arise before 6 April 2017, but b would, when the arrangements are disregarded, arise on or after that date, the relevant benefit (or part) is to be regarded for the purposes of this group of sections as arising on the date on which it would arise apart from the arrangements. Double taxation 23H 1 This section applies where\u2014 a income tax is charged on an individual by virtue of the application of section 23E in relation to a relevant benefit amount, and b at any time, a tax (whether income tax or another tax) is charged on the individual or another person otherwise than by virtue of the application of section 23E in relation to the relevant benefit concerned. 2 In order to avoid a double charge to tax, the individual may make a claim for one or more consequential adjustments to be made in respect of the tax charged as mentioned in subsection (1)(b). 3 On a claim under this section an officer of Revenue and Customs must make such of the consequential adjustments claimed (if any) as are just and reasonable. 4 The value of any consequential adjustments must not exceed the lesser of\u2014 a the income tax charged on the individual as mentioned in subsection (1)(a), and b the tax charged as mentioned in subsection (1)(b). 5 Consequential adjustments may be made\u2014 a in respect of any period, b by way of an assessment, the modification of an assessment, the amendment of a claim, or otherwise, and c despite any time limit imposed by or under any enactment. 3 In section 7(2) (income charged: profits of a tax year) at the end insert \u201c(including amounts treated as profits of the tax year under section 23E(1)). 4 The amendments made by this section have effect in relation to relevant benefits arising on or after 6 April 2017. 5 Schedule 12 contains provision about the application of new sections 23A to 23H of ITTOIA 2005 in relation to

participants in a co-ownership authorised contractual scheme together carry on a qualifying activity. 2 Each participant in the scheme is for the purposes of this Part to be regarded as carrying on the qualifying activity. 3 Subsection (2) applies in relation to a participant only to the extent that the profits or gains arising to the participant from the qualifying activity are, or (if there were any) would be, chargeable to tax. 4 But in determining for the purposes of subsection (1) whether or to what extent the participants in a co-ownership authorised contractual scheme together carry on a qualifying activity, assume that profits or gains arising to all participants from the qualifying activity are, or (if there were any) would be, chargeable to tax. Co-ownership schemes: election 262AB 1 The operator of a co-ownership authorised contractual scheme may make an election under this section. 2 The election must specify an accounting period of the scheme as the first accounting period in relation to which the election has effect. 3 That first accounting period must not\u2014 a be longer than 12 months, or b begin before 1 April 2017. 4 The election has effect for that first accounting period and all subsequent accounting periods of the scheme. 5 The election is irrevocable. 6 The election is made by notice to an officer of Revenue and Customs. Co-ownership schemes: calculation of allowance after election 262AC 1 This section applies where an election under section 262AB has effect for an accounting period of a co-ownership authorised contractual scheme (\u201c the relevant period \u201d). 2 The operator of the scheme is to calculate the allowances that would be available to the scheme under this Part in relation to the relevant period on the basis of the assumptions in subsection (3). 3 The assumptions are\u2014 a the scheme is a person; b the relevant period is a chargeable period for the purposes of this Act; c any qualifying activity carried on by the participants in the scheme together is carried on by the scheme; d property which was subject to the scheme at the beginning of the first accounting period for which the election has effect\u2014 i ceased to be owned by the participants at that time, and ii was acquired by the scheme at that time; e the disposal value to be brought into account in relation to the cessation of ownership and the acquisition referred to in paragraph (d) is the tax written-down value; f any property which became subject to the scheme at a time during an accounting period for which the election has effect was acquired by the scheme at that time; g property which ceased to be subject to the scheme at any such time ceased to be owned by the scheme at that time; h the disposal value to be brought into account in relation to the cessation of ownership referred to in paragraph (g) is the tax written-down value; i the scheme is not entitled to a first-year allowance or an annual investment allowance in respect of any expenditure. 4 The operator of the co-ownership authorised contractual scheme must allocate to each participant in the scheme a proportion (which may be zero) of the allowances calculated under this section. 5 The allocation is to be on the basis of what is just and reasonable. 6 In determining what is just and reasonable\u2014 a regard is to be had in particular to the relative size of each participant's holding of units in the scheme; b no regard is to be had to\u2014 i whether or to what extent a participant is liable to income tax or corporation tax, or ii any other circumstances relating to a participant's liability to tax. 7 If the participants in the scheme together carry on more than one qualifying activity, the calculation and allocation under this section are to be made separately for each activity. 8 The proportion of an allowance allocated by the operator to a participant under this section for a qualifying activity is the total amount of the allowance available to the participant under this Part in relation to the relevant period by virtue of carrying on that activity as a participant in the scheme. 9 In this section  \u201c tax written-down value \u201d, in relation to any cessation of ownership or acquisition, means such amount as would give rise to neither a balancing allowance nor a balancing charge. 10 For the purposes of subsection (9) assume that expenditure to which the disposal value relates is in its own pool. 11 For the purposes of subsections (3)(c) and (9), assume that profits or gains arising to all participants from the qualifying activity are, or (if there were any) would be, chargeable to tax. Co-ownership schemes: effect of election for participants 262AD 1 This section has effect where an election under section 262AB is made by the operator of a co-ownership authorised contractual scheme. 2 For the purposes of sections 61(1) and 196(1) (disposal events and values)\u2014 a a participant in the scheme is to be regarded as ceasing to own the participant's interest in the property subject to the scheme at the beginning of the first accounting period of the scheme for which the election has effect, and b the disposal value to be brought into account in relation to that cessation of ownership is the tax written-down value. 3 In subsection (2)(b)  \u201c tax written-down value \u201d means such amount as would give rise to neither a balancing allowance nor a balancing charge. 4 For the purposes of subsection (3) assume that\u2014 a expenditure to which the disposal value relates is in its own pool; b profits or gains arising to all participants from the qualifying activity are, or (if there were any) would be, chargeable to tax. Co-ownership schemes: effect of election for purchasers 262AE 1 This section has effect where\u2014 a an election under section 262AB is made by the operator of a co-ownership authorised contractual scheme, b property consisting of a fixture ceased to be subject to the scheme at any time in an accounting period for which the election has effect, c in a calculation made by the operator of the scheme under section 262AC(2) the assumption in section 262AC(3)(g) was made in relation to that fixture, and d a person (\u201cthe current owner\u201d) is treated as the owner of the fixture as a result of incurring capital expenditure on its provision (\u201cthe new expenditure\u201d). 2 In determining the current owner's qualifying expenditure\u2014 a if the disposal value statement requirement is not satisfied, the new expenditure is to be treated as nil, and b in any other case, any amount of the new expenditure which exceeds the assumed disposal value is to be left out of account (or, if such an amount has already been taken into account, is to be treated as an amount that should never have been taken into account). 3 The disposal value statement requirement is that\u2014 a the operator of the scheme has, no later than 2 years after the date when the fixture ceased to be property subject to the scheme, made a written statement of the assumed disposal value, and b the current owner has obtained that statement or a copy of it (directly or indirectly) from the operator of the scheme. 4 Sections 185 (fixture on which a plant and machinery allowance has been claimed) and 187A (effect of changes in ownership of fixture) do not apply in relation to the new expenditure. 5 In this section  \u201c assumed disposal value \u201d means the disposal value that, in making the calculation referred to in subsection (1)(c), was assumed to be brought into account pursuant to section 262AC(3)(h).
