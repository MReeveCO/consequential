becomes aware (whether because the whistle-blower has contacted the Commission or for any other reason) but only if the whistle-blower informs the Commission, before the beginning of the investigation, that he or she consents to an investigation taking place. 2 In deciding whether to investigate, the Commission must take into account the public interest. 3 For the purposes of this

a police force or a person serving with the police, c the matter to which the concern relates is not\u2014 i about the conditions of service of persons serving with the police, or ii a matter that is,

29F (which deals with the position where the concern is a conduct matter for the purposes of Part 2) and to section 29G (which deals with the position where the concern is a DSI matter for the purposes of that Part). 5 Schedule 3A (which makes provision about the procedure etc where the Commission decides to investigate under subsection (1)) has effect. Commission's powers and duties where it decides not to investigate 29E 1 If the Commission decides not to carry out an investigation under section 29D(1), the Commission must inform the whistle-blower of the decision. 2 In such a case, the Commission may, with the consent of the whistle-blower\u2014 a disclose the nature of the concern to the appropriate authority, and b make recommendations in the light of the concern. 3 In this Part, except where otherwise provided,  \u201c appropriate authority \u201d means\u2014 a if the concern relates to a chief officer or an acting chief officer, the local policing body for the area of the police force of which he or she is a member; b if the concern relates to any other person, the chief officer under whose direction and control that person is; c if the concern does not relate to any particular persons, the chief officer of the police force to which the concern relates. 4 The Secretary of State may by regulations make further provision about recommendations under subsection (2). 5 The regulations may (amongst other things)\u2014 a describe the kinds of recommendations that the Commission may make under subsection (2); b specify the persons to whom the recommendations may be made; c authorise the Commission to require a response to any recommendation made by the Commission under subsection (2).

Special provision for  \u201cDSI matters\u201d 29G 1 Before deciding whether to carry out an investigation under section 29D(1), the Commission must consider whether the concern is about a death or serious injury matter (\u201ca DSI matter\u201d) for the purposes of Part 2 (see section 12(2A)). 2 If the Commission determines that the concern is about a DSI matter for the purposes of Part 2\u2014 a it may not carry out an investigation under section 29D(1), and b it must notify the appropriate authority in relation to the DSI matter. 3 Where the appropriate authority in relation to the DSI matter is notified under subsection (2), it must record the matter under paragraph 14A of Schedule 3 to this Act as a DSI matter. 4 The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision modifying Schedule 3 in relation to a DSI matter that, in accordance with subsection (3), is recorded under paragraph 14A of that Schedule but only for the purpose of making provision for the protection of the anonymity of whistle-blowers. 5 In this section, references to the appropriate authority in relation to a DSI matter have the same meaning as in Part 2 (see section 29). Commission's powers and duties where whistle-blower is deceased 29H 1 The power of the Commission to carry out an investigation under section 29D(1) applies where the whistle-blower dies before the Commission becomes aware of the concern (or before it decides to investigate). 2 Any investigation begun by the Commission under section 29D(1) before the death of the whistle-blower may be continued after the death. 3 Where a whistle-blower dies\u2014 a any requirement under this Part to obtain the consent of the whistle-blower may be satisfied by obtaining the consent of that person's approved representative; b any requirement under this Part to give any document or other information to the whistle-blower may be satisfied by giving the document or other information to the person's approved representative; c any requirement under this Part not to disclose the identity of the whistle-blower does not apply or (where the Commission became aware of the concern before the death) ceases to apply. 4 For the purpose of this section,  \u201c approved representative \u201d means a person who has been approved by the Commission for the purposes of this Part. 5 The Commission may only approve a person who is\u2014 a the widow or widower (or surviving civil partner) of the deceased whistle-blower, b a personal representative (within the meaning of section 55(1)(xi) of the Administration of Estates Act 1925) of the deceased whistle-blower, or c any other person appearing to the Commission to have, by reason of a family or similar relationship with the deceased whistle-blower, a relevant interest in the outcome of the concern.

Protection of anonymity of whistle-blowers 29J 1 The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision setting out the circumstances in which the Commission is required or authorised to disclose information falling within subsection (2)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(or any particular description of such information) to persons specified, or of a description specified, in the regulations. 2 The information falling within this subsection is\u2014 a the identity of a whistle-blower or information that might (whether alone or with other information) tend to reveal that identity; b the nature of a concern raised by a whistle-blower. 3 The power conferred by subsection (1) may be exercised only to the extent that the Secretary of State considers necessary for any of the permitted disclosure purposes. 4 \u201cThe permitted disclosure purposes\u201d are\u2014 a the protection of the interests of national security; b the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension of offenders; c the institution or conduct of criminal proceedings; d the investigation of allegations of misconduct against whistle-blowers and the taking of disciplinary proceedings or other appropriate action in relation to such allegations; e investigations under Part 2 that relate to whistle-blowers; f investigations under this Part; g any other purpose that is for the protection of the public interest. 5 Except as provided by regulations under subsection (1) or by any other provision of this Part, the Commission may not disclose information falling within subsection (2) unless the whistle-blower consents to the disclosure. Other restrictions on disclosure of information 29K 1 The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision setting out the circumstances in which the Commission is required or authorised to disclose information falling within subsection (2)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(or any particular description of such information) to persons specified, or of a description specified, in the regulations. 2 The information falling within this subsection is\u2014 a information relating to an investigation under section 29D; b information relating to the outcome of any such investigation. 3 The power conferred by subsection (1) may be exercised only to the extent that the Secretary of State considers necessary for any of the permitted disclosure purposes. 4 In this section,  \u201c the permitted disclosure purposes \u201d has the same meaning as in section 29J. 5 Except as provided by regulations under subsection (1) or by any other provision of this Part, the Commission may not disclose information falling within subsection (2).

performed by an officer who is not at the police station where the arrested person is held. 5 Subsections (5)(b) and (9)(iii) and (iv) of that section are each to be read as if, instead of requiring the officer to make a record, they required the officer to cause another police officer to make a record. 6 Subsection (6) of that section is to be read as if it required the officer to give the persons mentioned in that subsection an opportunity to make representations\u2014 a if facilities exist for the immediate transmission of written representations to the officer, either in writing by means of those facilities or orally by means of the live link, or b in any other case, orally by means of the live link. 7 Subsection (9) of that section is to be read as if the reference in paragraph

further detention of a person, or the hearing of an application under section 44 for an extension of such a warrant, if\u2014 a a custody officer considers that the use of a live link for that purpose is appropriate, b the person to whom the application relates has had legal advice on the use of the live link, c the appropriate consent to the use of the live link has been given, and d it is not contrary to the interests of justice to give the direction. 2 In subsection (1)(c),  \u201c the appropriate consent \u201d means\u2014 a in relation to a person who has attained the age of 18, the

person who has not attained the age of 14, the consent of his or her parent or guardian. 3 Where a live link direction is given, the requirement under section 43(2)(b) for the person to whom the application relates to be brought before the court for the hearing does not apply. 4 In this section\u2014 \u201c live link direction \u201d means a direction that a live link be used for the purposes of the hearing; \u201c live link \u201d means an arrangement by which a person (when not in the place where the hearing is being held) is able to see and hear, and to be seen and heard by, the court during a hearing (and for this purpose any impairment of eyesight or hearing is to be disregarded); \u201c vulnerable adult \u201d means a person aged 18 or over who may have difficulty understanding the purpose of the hearing or what occurs at it (whether because of a mental disorder or for any other reason); \u201c appropriate adult \u201d, in relation to a person aged under 18, means\u2014 the

purposes \u201d has the meaning given by section 101(2) of the Police Act 1996. 3 In section 45 (detention before charge-supplementary), in subsection (1), for  \u201csections 43 and 44\u201d

Appeals and other supplementary provision Appeal against refusal to disregard convictions or caution 101H 1 The applicant may appeal to the High Court in Northern Ireland if\u2014 a the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland makes a decision of the kind mentioned in section 101C(3)(b), and b the High Court gives permission for an appeal against the decision. 2 On such an appeal, the High Court must make its decision only on the basis of the evidence that was available to the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland. 3 If the High Court decides that it appears as mentioned in condition A in section 101A, it must make an order to that effect. 4 Otherwise, it must dismiss the appeal. 5 A conviction or caution to which an order under subsection (3) relates becomes a disregarded conviction or caution when the period of 14 days beginning with the day on which the order was made has ended. 6 There is no appeal from a decision of the High Court under this section. Advisers 101I 1 The Department of Justice in Northern Ireland may appoint persons to advise whether, in any case referred to them by the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland, the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland should decide as mentioned in condition A in section 101A. 2 The Department of Justice in Northern Ireland may disclose to a person so appointed such information (including anything within section 101C(1)(a) or (b)) as the Department of Justice considers relevant to the provision of such advice. 3 The Department of Justice in Northern Ireland may pay expenses and allowances to a person so appointed.

conspiracy or incitement, the references in this Chapter to the conduct constituting the offence are references to the conduct to which the attempt, conspiracy or incitement related (whether or not
