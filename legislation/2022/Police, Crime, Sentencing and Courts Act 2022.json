3 An \u201capplication for a minimum term review\u201d is an application made by a relevant young offender for a reduction in the minimum term. 4 Where a relevant young offender has made an

Where the Secretary of State decides not to refer the application to the High Court, the Secretary of State must give notice of that decision, and the reasons for it, to the relevant young offender. 7 If the relevant young offender makes representations or provides further evidence in support of the application before the end of the period of 4 weeks beginning with the day on which the notice under subsection  (6)  is given, the Secretary of State must consider the representations or evidence and\u2014 a if the Secretary of State is no longer of the view mentioned in subsection  (5)(b) , refer

confirming the minimum term (see section 27B), or b in a case where the application is not referred to the court, when the Secretary of State gives the relevant young offender notice in relation to the application under subsection  (6) . 11 There is no right for any person who is serving a DHMP sentence to request a review of the minimum term other than that conferred by this section. Power of High Court to reduce minimum term 27B 1 This section applies where the Secretary of State refers an application for a minimum term review made by a relevant young offender under section 27A to the High Court. 2 The court may\u2014 a make a reduction order in relation to relevant young offender, or b confirm the minimum term in respect of the offender\u2019s DHMP sentence, and a decision of the court under this subsection is final. 3 A reduction order is an order that the relevant young offender\u2019s minimum term is to be reduced to such part of the offender\u2019s DHMP sentence as the court considers appropriate and is specified in the reduction order. 4 In deciding whether to make a reduction order, the court must, in particular, take into account any evidence\u2014 a that the relevant young offender\u2019s rehabilitation has been exceptional; b that the continued detention or imprisonment of the offender for the remainder of the minimum term is likely to give rise to a serious risk to the welfare or continued rehabilitation of the offender which cannot be eliminated or mitigated to a significant degree. 5 In this section \u201c DHMP sentence \u201d, \u201c minimum term \u201d and \u201c relevant young offender \u201d have the same meaning as in section 27A. 2 In section 28 of that Act (duty to release certain life prisoners), in subsection (1A), for the words from \u201cthe part of\u201d to the end substitute\u2014 a the part of the sentence specified in the minimum term order, or b in a case where one or more reduction orders has been made in relation to the prisoner (see section 27B), the part of the sentence specified in the most recent of those orders. 3 A pre-commencement application\u2014 a is to be treated for the purposes of subsection  (4)  of section 27A of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 as if it was made under that section if, at the time the relevant young offender made the application, they had served at least half of the minimum term;

Duration of serious violence reduction orders 342D 1 A serious violence reduction order takes effect on the day it is made, subject to subsections (3) and (4). 2 A serious violence reduction order must specify the period for which it has effect, which must be a fixed period of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years. 3 Subsection (4) applies in relation to a serious violence reduction order if\u2014 a the offender has been remanded in or committed to custody by an order of a court, or b a custodial sentence has been imposed on the offender or the offender is serving or otherwise subject to a such a sentence. 4 The order may provide that it does not take effect until the offender is released from custody or ceases to be subject to a custodial sentence. 5 Where a court makes a serious violence reduction order and the offender is already subject to such an order, the earlier order ceases to have effect. Serious violence reduction orders: powers of constables 342E 1 This section applies where a serious violence reduction order is in effect. 2 A constable may search the offender for the purpose of ascertaining whether the offender has a bladed article or an offensive weapon with them. 3 A constable may detain the offender for the purpose of carrying out the search. 4 A constable may seize anything that the constable finds in the course of the search if the constable reasonably suspects it to be a bladed article or an offensive weapon. 5 The powers in this section may be exercised only while the offender is in a public place. 6 A constable may use reasonable force, if necessary, for the purpose of exercising a power conferred by this section. 7 The powers conferred on a constable by this section are additional to powers which the constable has at common law or by virtue of any other enactment and does not affect those powers. Retention and disposal of things seized under section  342E 342F 1 Any thing seized by a constable under section  342E  may be retained in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State under this section. 2 The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision\u2014 a regulating the retention and safekeeping of things seized by a constable under section  342E , and b regulating the disposal and destruction of such things in such circumstances as the regulations may prescribed. 3 Regulations under this section are subject to the negative resolution procedure.

This is subject to sections 96ZB (young offenders: parental notices) and 96ZC (modifications of notification requirements). 2 This section applies to P if P has been given a notice under subsection (3) and that notice has not been cancelled. 3 A constable may give a notice to P if\u2014 a the conditions in subsections (6), (7) and (8) are met in respect of P, and b an officer of at least the rank of inspector has authorised the giving of the notice to P. 4 A notice given to P under subsection (3) must be given to P in person and must contain details of\u2014 a the notifications that P is required to give under this Part, b when those notifications must be given, and c where those notifications may be given. 5 A notice given under subsection (3) may be cancelled by a constable giving notice in writing to P in person but such a cancellation must be authorised by an officer of at least the rank of inspector. 6 The first condition is that under the law in force in a country outside the United Kingdom\u2014 a P has been convicted of a relevant offence (whether or not P has been punished for it), b a court exercising jurisdiction under that law has made in respect of a relevant offence a finding equivalent to a finding that P is not guilty by reason of insanity, c such a court has made in respect of a relevant offence a finding equivalent to a finding that P is under a disability and did the act charged against P in respect of the offence, or d P has been cautioned in respect of a relevant offence. 7 The second condition is that\u2014 a the first condition is met because of a conviction, finding or caution which occurred on or after 1 September 1997, b the first condition is met because of a conviction or finding which occurred before that date, but P was dealt with in respect of the offence or finding on or after that date, or has yet to be dealt with in respect of it, or c the first condition is met because of a conviction or finding which occurred before that date, but on that date P was, in respect of the offence or finding, subject under the law in force in the country concerned to detention, supervision or any other disposal equivalent to any of those mentioned in section 81(3) (read with sections 81(6) and 131). 8 The third condition is that the period set out in section 82 (as it would have effect as modified by section 96ZC(2) and (3) if this section applied to P) in respect of the relevant offence has not expired. 9 In this section and section 96ZC \u201c relevant offence \u201d means an act which\u2014 a constituted an offence under the law in force in the country concerned, and b would have constituted an offence listed in Schedule 3 (other than at paragraph 60) if it had been done in any part of the United Kingdom. 10 For the purposes of subsection (9)(a), an act punishable under the law in force in a country outside the United Kingdom constitutes an offence under that law however it is described in that law.

monitoring requirements 122EA 1 Subsections  (2)  and  (3)  apply for the purpose of determining whether a court may impose, under section 122A(9B) or section 122E(3B), an electronic monitoring requirement on the defendant in a sexual risk order or interim sexual risk order. 2 If there is a person (other than the defendant) without whose co-operation it would be impracticable to secure the monitoring in question, the requirement may not be imposed without that person\u2019s consent. 3 The court may impose the requirement only if\u2014 a it has been notified by the Secretary of State that electronic monitoring arrangements are available in the relevant area, and b it is satisfied that the necessary provision can be made under the arrangements currently available. 4 In subsection (3)(a) \u201c the relevant area \u201d means\u2014 a the local justice area in which it appears to the court that the defendant resides or will reside, and b in a case where it is proposed to include in the order\u2014 i a requirement that the defendant must remain, for specified periods, at a specified place, or ii a provision prohibiting the defendant from entering a specified place or area, the local justice area in which the place or area proposed to be specified is situated. \u201c Specified \u201d means specified in the sexual risk order or interim sexual risk order under which the electronic monitoring requirement is imposed. 5 A sexual risk order or interim sexual risk order that includes an electronic monitoring requirement must specify the person who is to be responsible for the monitoring. 6 The person specified under subsection (5) (\u201cthe responsible person\u201d) must be of a description specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State. 7 Where a sexual risk order or interim sexual risk order imposes an electronic monitoring requirement on the defendant, the defendant must (among other things)\u2014 a submit, as required from time to time by the responsible person, to\u2014 i being fitted with, or the installation of, any necessary apparatus, and ii the inspection or repair of any apparatus fitted or installed for the purposes of the monitoring, b not interfere with, or with the working of, any apparatus fitted or installed for the purposes of the monitoring, and c take any steps required by the responsible person for the purpose of keeping in working order any apparatus fitted or installed for the purpose of the monitoring. These obligations have effect as requirements of the sexual risk order or interim sexual risk order under which the electronic monitoring requirement is imposed. 8 A sexual risk order or an interim sexual risk order may not provide for an electronic monitoring requirement to have effect for more than 12 months. 9 Subsection (8) does not prevent an electronic monitoring requirement from being extended for a further period (of no more than 12 months each time) under section 122D. Data from electronic monitoring: code of practice 122EB 1 The Secretary of State must issue a code of practice relating to the processing of data gathered in the course of electronic monitoring of defendants under electronic monitoring requirements imposed by\u2014 a sexual risk orders, b relevant Scottish orders within the meaning of section 136ZI that have been renewed or varied as mentioned in subsection (11) of that section (variation etc by court in England and Wales to impose electronic monitoring requirement), and c risk of sexual harm orders that have been renewed or varied as mentioned in section 136ZJ(7) (variation etc by court in England and Wales to impose electronic monitoring requirement). 2 A failure to observe a code issued under this section does not of itself make a person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings. 15 In section 136ZA, after subsection (2) insert\u2014 3 A requirement that is imposed by a relevant order and that relates to the electronic monitoring of a person\u2019s compliance with the prohibitions or requirements imposed by the order is to be treated for the purposes of subsection (2) as a requirement that is expressly confined to a particular locality. 16 In section 138(3), after \u201ccontaining\u201d insert  \u201conly regulations under section 103FA(6) or section 122EA(6) or\u201d ."}, {"act": "Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022", "year": 2022, "section": "179", "section_title": "Positive requirements and electronic monitoring requirements: service courts", "section_text": "179 In section 137(3) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (service courts: sexual harm prevention orders)\u2014 a in paragraph (a)\u2014 i after \u201c103A(3)\u201d insert  \u201cand (4)\u201d , and ii for the words from \u201cand 103J\u201d to \u201cSentencing Code\u201d substitute  \u201c, 103FA(3)(a), (4) and (6) and 103J of this Act, and sections 348A(3)(a), (4) and (6) and 355 to 357 of the Sentencing Code\u201d , b in paragraph (b), in the words before sub-paragraph (i)\u2014 i for \u201c103A(1) and (2)\u201d substitute  \u201c103A(1), (2) and (3A), and ii for the words from \u201cand 103G\u201d to \u201cSentencing Code\u201d substitute  \u201c, 103FA(1), (2), (3)(b) and (5) to (9), 103FB and 103G to 103I of this Act, and sections 343 to 348, 348A(1), (2), (3)(b) and (5) to (9), 348B to 354 and 358 of the Sentencing Code\u201d , c in paragraph (b)(i), after \u201cparagraphs\u201d insert  \u201c(ba), (bb)\u201d , d after paragraph (b) insert\u2014 ba if section 103CA applies to the defendant at a time when the defendant is a person subject to service law or a civilian subject to service discipline, the reference in section 103CA(4)(c) (requirements included in order: report on compliance) to the appropriate chief officer of police is to be read as a reference to a Provost Marshal;
