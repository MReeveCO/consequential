Serious contravention notices 58Z5 1 The regulatory authority may give a serious contravention notice to a local authority or a registered building control approver if it appears to the regulatory authority (following an investigation under section  58Z3  or otherwise) that the condition in subsection  (2)  or  (3)  is met. 2 The condition in this subsection is that\u2014 a the local authority or registered building control approver has contravened operational standards rules, and b as a result of the contravention the safety of persons in or about buildings has been, or may have been, put at risk. 3 This condition in this subsection is that the local authority or registered building control approver\u2014 a has been given an improvement notice under section  58Z4 , and b has failed to remedy the contravention of operational standards rules in respect of which the notice was given. 4 A serious contravention notice is a notice requiring the local authority or registered building control approver to remedy the contravention in question by doing, or by refraining from doing, anything specified in the order. 5 A serious contravention notice may have effect\u2014 a until it is revoked, or b for a period specified in the notice. 6 Where the regulatory authority gives a serious contravention notice, it must also give the local authority or registered building control approver a statement of the reasons for giving the notice. 7 Where the regulatory authority gives a serious contravention notice to a registered building control approver, in prescribed cases it must as soon as reasonably practicable provide copies of the notice and the statement\u2014 a to each local authority in England, where the regulatory authority is the regulator, or b to each local authority in Wales, where the regulatory authority is the Welsh Ministers. 8 Where the regulatory authority giving a serious contravention notice is the regulator, it must as soon as reasonably practicable provide copies of the notice and the statement of reasons to the Secretary of State. 9 The local authority or registered building control approver to whom the serious contravention notice is given may appeal to the appropriate court or tribunal against the notice. 10 A person who, without reasonable excuse, contravenes a serious contravention notice commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine. Continuing failure to meet standards: registered building control approvers 58Z6 1 This section applies where\u2014 a the regulatory authority has given a registered building control approver one or more serious contravention notices under  section 58Z5 , and b it appears to the regulatory authority that the way in which the approver exercises their building control functions\u2014 i falls short of the standards expected, and ii puts, or may put, the safety of persons in or about buildings at risk, and is likely to continue to do so. 2 The regulatory authority may cancel the approver\u2019s registration. 3 But before cancelling a registered building control approver\u2019s registration under  subsection (2)  the regulatory authority must\u2014 a give the approver notice that it is considering its registration under that subsection, and explain its reasons, and b invite the approver to make representations within a period specified in the notice (which must not be less than 14 days). 4 Where the regulatory authority cancels a registered building control approver\u2019s registration under  subsection (2)  it must as soon as reasonably practicable\u2014 a notify the approver that it has done so, b give the approver a statement of its reasons, and c notify\u2014 i each local authority in England, where the regulatory authority is the regulator, or ii each local authority in Wales, where the regulatory authority is the Welsh Ministers. 5 A registered building control approver may appeal to the appropriate court or tribunal against the cancellation of its registration under  subsection (2) . Continuing failure to meet standards: local authorities in England 58Z7 1 This section applies where\u2014 a the regulatory authority is the regulator, b the regulatory authority has given a local authority one or more serious contravention notices under  section 58Z5 , and c it appears to the regulatory authority that the way in which the local authority exercises their building control functions\u2014 i falls short of the standards expected, and ii puts, or may put, the safety of persons in or about buildings at risk, and is likely to continue to do so. 2 The regulatory authority may recommend to the Secretary of State that the Secretary of State make an order under section 116(4) (transfer of functions to the Secretary of State or another local authority). 3 But before making a recommendation under  subsection (2)  the regulatory authority must\u2014 a give the local authority notice that it is considering making a recommendation under that subsection, and explain its reasons, and b invite the authority to make representations within a period specified in the notice (which must not be less than 14 days). 4 Where the regulatory authority makes a recommendation under  subsection (2)  it must as soon as reasonably practicable\u2014 a notify the local authority that it has done so, and b give the local authority a statement of its reasons. 5 A local authority may appeal to the tribunal against a recommendation under  subsection (2) . Inspection of local authorities and registered building control approvers Inspections 58Z8 1 The regulatory authority may carry out an inspection of a local authority, or a registered building control approver, in relation to their exercise of building control functions. 2 The purposes for which an inspection may be carried out include\u2014 a ascertaining the efficiency and effectiveness of the local authority or registered building control approver in exercising their building control functions; b verifying any information provided by the local authority or registered building control approver to the regulatory authority, in connection with their building control functions. Information sharing Sharing of information between regulatory authorities 58Z9 1 The regulator may disclose information held in connection with a function under this Part to the Welsh Ministers for the purposes of\u2014 a a function of the regulator under this Part, or b a function of the Welsh Ministers under this Part. 2 The Welsh Ministers may disclose information held in connection with a function under this Part to the regulator for the purposes of\u2014 a a function of the Welsh Ministers under this Part, or b a function of the regulator under this Part. 3 Except as provided by subsection (4), the disclosure of information under this section does not breach\u2014 a any obligation of confidence owed by the person making the disclosure, or b any other restriction on the disclosure of information (however imposed). 4 This section does not authorise a disclosure of information if the disclosure would contravene the data protection legislation (but in determining whether a disclosure would do so, take into account the powers conferred by this section).
