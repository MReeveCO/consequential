When a Part 4ZA order can be made and its effect   27ZF    1   The court may make a Part 4ZA order if (and only if)\u2014   a   it is satisfied that the requirements for applying for the order have been met, and     b   the required grantor has not objected to the making of the order.       2   A Part 4ZA order is an order which imposes on the operator and the required grantor an agreement between them\u2014   a   by which the required grantor confers on the operator the code right identified in the request notice in respect of the relevant land so identified, or     b   which provides for the code right identified in that notice, which is exercisable by the operator in respect of the relevant land so identified, otherwise to bind the required grantor.       3   In this code, a \u201c Part 4ZA code right \u201d means a code right which is conferred by or otherwise binds the required grantor pursuant to an agreement imposed by a Part 4ZA order.     4   The terms of an agreement imposed by a Part 4ZA order are to be those specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State.     5   Regulations under sub-paragraph (4) must, in particular, provide for an agreement to include terms\u2014   a   relating to the provision by the operator to the required grantor of details of the works to be carried out in the exercise of the Part 4ZA code right (\u201c the works \u201d);     b   relating to the obtaining by the operator of any consent, permit, licence, permission, authorisation or approval which is necessary for the works to be carried out;     c   relating to the giving of notice by the operator to the required grantor or other specified persons before entering on the relevant land in the exercise of the Part 4ZA code right or carrying out the works;     d   restricting the operator\u2019s right to enter on the relevant land to specified times, except in cases of emergency;     e   as to the manner in which the works are to be carried out by the operator;     f   relating to the restoration by the operator of the relevant land at the end of the works, to the reasonable satisfaction of the required grantor;     g   relating to the need for insurance cover or indemnification of the required grantor;     h   prohibiting the operator from installing apparatus on the relevant land (so that the operator may only install apparatus under or over the relevant land) in the exercise of the Part 4ZA code right;     i   relating to the maintenance or upgrading by the operator of apparatus installed under or over the relevant land (\u201cthe apparatus\u201d);     j   imposing requirements or restrictions on the required grantor for the purposes of\u2014   i   preventing damage to the apparatus,     ii   facilitating access to the apparatus for the operator, or     iii   otherwise preventing or minimising disruption to the operation of the apparatus;       k   relating to assignment of the agreement;     l   aimed at ensuring that nothing done by the operator in the exercise of the Part 4ZA code right unnecessarily prevents or inhibits the provision of an electronic communications service by any other operator.       6   Before making regulations under sub-paragraph (4), the Secretary of State must consult\u2014   a   operators,     b   persons appearing to the Secretary of State to represent owners of interests in land who are likely to be affected by the regulations, and     c   any other persons the Secretary of State thinks appropriate.       7   In sub-paragraph (5), \u201c specified \u201d means specified, or of a description specified, in the regulations.        Expiry of Part 4ZA code rights   27ZG    1   A Part 4ZA code right ceases to be conferred on the operator by, or otherwise to bind, the required grantor\u2014   a   if a replacement agreement comes into effect, in accordance with that agreement,     b   if the court decides to refuse an application by the operator for the imposition of a replacement agreement, in accordance with that decision, or     c   if the right has not ceased to have that effect as mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) before the end of the specified period beginning with the day on which the agreement imposed by the Part 4ZA order comes into effect, at the end of that period.       2   In sub-paragraph (1) a \u201c replacement agreement \u201d, in relation to a Part 4ZA code right, means an agreement under Part 2 by which the required grantor confers a code right on the operator, or otherwise agrees to be bound by a code right which is exercisable by the operator, where that right is in respect of the same land as the Part 4ZA code right.     3   In sub-paragraph (1)(c) \u201c specified period \u201d means the period, of no more than 6 years, specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State.     4   The required grantor has the right, subject to and in accordance with Part 6 of this code, to require the operator to remove any electronic communications apparatus placed under or over the relevant land in the exercise of a Part 4ZA code right which has ceased to be conferred on the operator by, or otherwise to bind, the required grantor.        Compensation   27ZH    1   This paragraph applies where the court has made a Part 4ZA order.     2   The court may, on the application of the required grantor, order the operator to pay compensation to the required grantor for any loss or damage that has been sustained or will be sustained by the required grantor as a result of the exercise by the operator of the Part 4ZA code right.     3   An application for an order under this paragraph may be made at any time after the Part 4ZA order is made (including at a time when the Part 4ZA code right has ceased to be conferred on the operator by, or otherwise to bind, the required grantor).     4   An order under this paragraph may\u2014   a   specify the amount of compensation to be paid by the operator, or     b   give directions for the determination of any such amount.       5   Directions under sub-paragraph (4)(b) may provide\u2014   a   for the amount of compensation to be agreed between the operator and the required grantor;     b   for any dispute about that amount to be determined by arbitration.       6   An order under this paragraph may provide for the operator\u2014   a   to make a lump sum payment,     b   to make periodical payments,     c   to make a payment or payments on the occurrence of an event or events, or     d   to make a payment or payments in such other form or at such other time or times as the court may direct.       7   Paragraph 84 makes further provision about compensation in the case of a Part 4ZA order.        Interpretation of this Part   27ZI   In this Part\u2014     \u201c Part 4ZA order \u201d has the meaning given by paragraph  27ZD (1);      \u201c premises \u201d includes a part of premises;      \u201c request notice \u201d has the meaning given by paragraph  27ZC (1)(d);      \u201c required grantor \u201d has the meaning given by paragraph  27ZC (1)(c).             2   The Schedule contains consequential amendments.
