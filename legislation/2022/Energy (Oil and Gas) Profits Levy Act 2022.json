company for an accounting period are to the levy profits or loss for the period as determined in accordance with subsections  (4)  and  (5) . 8 If a company makes a qualifying levy loss for an accounting period, relief may be available for some or all of the loss in accordance with\u2014 a Part 1 of Schedule 1 (carry back or forward of qualifying levy losses), or b Part 2 of that Schedule
