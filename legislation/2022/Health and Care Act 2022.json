Process for establishing initial integrated care boards   14Z26    1   NHS England must publish a list of the initial areas for which integrated care boards are to be established (each of which is referred to in this section as an \u201c initial area \u201d).     2   The relevant clinical commissioning group or groups for an initial area must propose the constitution of the first integrated care board to be established for that area.     3   Before making a proposal under subsection  (2) , the relevant clinical commissioning group or groups must consult any persons they consider it appropriate to consult (and it is immaterial for this purpose whether the consultation is carried out before or after this section comes into force).     4   When establishing the first integrated care board under section  14Z25  for an initial area, NHS England must give effect to any proposal under subsection  (2)  unless it considers that\u2014   a   the proposal is inappropriate, or     b   the relevant clinical commissioning group or groups have not carried out an appropriate consultation under subsection  (3) ,    and in that case NHS England must determine the terms of the constitution itself.     5   Nothing in this section\u2014   a   prevents NHS England from establishing the first integrated care board for an initial area in a case where the relevant clinical commissioning group or groups have failed within a reasonable period to make a proposal under subsection  (2) , or     b   limits the re-exercise of the power in section  14Z25 .       6   NHS England may publish guidance for clinical commissioning groups about the exercise of their functions under this section.     7   A clinical commissioning group must have regard to guidance published under this section.     8   In this section \u201c the relevant clinical commissioning group or groups \u201d means\u2014   a   in relation to an area that coincides with the area of a clinical commissioning group, that group;     b   in relation to an area that includes the whole or part of the area of more than one clinical commissioning group, those groups acting jointly.          Abolition of clinical commissioning groups   14Z27    1   Any clinical commissioning group in existence immediately before the appointed day is abolished at the beginning of that day.     2   In this section \u201c the appointed day \u201d has the same meaning as in section  14Z25 .        Transfer schemes in connection with integrated care boards   14Z28    1   NHS England may, in connection with the abolition of a clinical commissioning group under section 14Z27, make a scheme for the transfer of the group\u2019s property, rights or liabilities to NHS England or an integrated care board.     2   NHS England may, in connection with the establishment of an integrated care board, make a scheme for the transfer of property, rights or liabilities to the board from\u2014   a   NHS England,     b   an NHS trust established under section 25,     c   an NHS foundation trust, or     d   a Special Health Authority established under section 28.       3   NHS England may, in connection with the variation of the constitution of an integrated care board or the abolition of an integrated care board, make a scheme for the transfer of the board\u2019s property, rights or liabilities to NHS England or an integrated care board.     4   The reference in subsection  (3)  to the variation of the constitution of an integrated care board is to its variation by order under section 14Z25 or under provision included in its constitution by virtue of paragraph 14 of Schedule 1B.     5   NHS England must exercise its powers under subsection (1) or (3) so as to ensure that\u2014   a   on the abolition of a clinical commissioning group whose area coincides with that of an integrated care board, all of the group\u2019s property, rights and liabilities (other than criminal liabilities) are transferred to that board;     b   on the abolition of a clinical commissioning group whose area does not coincide with that of an integrated care board, all of the group\u2019s property, rights and liabilities (other than criminal liabilities) are transferred to one or more integrated care boards;     c   on the abolition of an integrated care board, all of the board\u2019s liabilities (other than criminal liabilities) are transferred.       6   The things that may be transferred under a transfer scheme include\u2014   a   property, rights and liabilities that could not otherwise be transferred;     b   property acquired, and rights and liabilities arising, after the making of the scheme;     c   criminal liabilities.       7   A transfer scheme may\u2014   a   create rights, or impose liabilities, in relation to property or rights transferred;     b   make provision about the continuing effect of things done by, on behalf of or in relation to the transferor in respect of anything transferred;     c   make provision about the continuation of things (including legal proceedings) in the process of being done by, on behalf of or in relation to the transferor in respect of anything transferred;     d   make provision for references to the transferor in an instrument or other document in respect of anything transferred to be treated as references to the transferee;     e   make provision for the shared ownership or use of property;     f   make provision which is the same as or similar to the TUPE regulations;     g   make other consequential, supplementary, incidental or transitional provision.       8   A transfer scheme may provide\u2014   a   for modifications by agreement;     b   for modifications to have effect from the date when the original scheme came into effect.       9   In subsection  (7)(f) , \u201c the TUPE regulations \u201d means the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 ( S.I. 2006/246 ).     10   In this section\u2014   a   references to rights and liabilities include rights and liabilities relating to a contract of employment;     b   references to the transfer of property include the grant of a lease.           Constitution: publication   Duty for integrated care board to publish constitution   14Z29   Each integrated care board must publish its constitution (as varied from time to time by order under section  14Z25  or under provision included in its constitution by virtue of paragraph  15  of Schedule 1B).       Conflicts of interest   Register of interests and management of conflicts of interests   14Z30    1   Each integrated care board must maintain one or more registers of the interests of\u2014   a   members of the board,     b   members of its committees or sub-committees, and     c   its employees.       2   Each integrated care board must publish the registers maintained under subsection  (1)  or make arrangements to ensure that members of the public have access to the registers on request.     3   Each integrated care board must make arrangements to ensure\u2014   a   that a person mentioned in subsection  (1)  declares any conflict or potential conflict of interest that the person has in relation to a decision to be made in the exercise of the commissioning functions of the integrated care board,     b   that any such declaration is made as soon as practicable after the person becomes aware of the conflict or potential conflict and, in any event, within 28 days of the person becoming aware, and     c   that any such declaration is included in the registers maintained under subsection  (1) .       4   Each integrated care board must make arrangements for managing conflicts and potential conflicts of interest in such a way as to ensure that they do not, and do not appear to, affect the integrity of the board\u2019s decision-making processes.     5   For the purposes of this section, the commissioning functions of an integrated care board are the functions of the board in arranging for the provision of services as part of the health service.             3   In section 272 (orders, regulations, rules and directions), in subsection (1), before paragraph (a) insert\u2014    za   section  14Z25 (2) ,     .     4   Schedule 2 inserts into the National Health Service Act 2006 a new Schedule 1B (integrated care boards: constitution etc) and contains a consequential amendment.
