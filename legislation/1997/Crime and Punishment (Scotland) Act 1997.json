Variation of restriction of liberty order. 245E 1 Where a restriction of liberty order is in force either the offender or any person responsible for monitoring his compliance with the order may apply to the court which made the order for a review of it. 2 On an application made under subsection (1) above, and after hearing both the offender and any person responsible for monitoring his compliance with the order, the court may by order, if it appears to it to be in the interests of justice to do so\u2014 a vary the order by\u2014 i amending or deleting any of its requirements; ii inserting further requirements; or iii subject to subsection (3) of section 245A of this Act, increasing the period for which the order has to run; or b revoke the order. 3 Where the court, on the application of a person other than the offender, proposes to\u2014 a exercise the power conferred by paragraph (a) of subsection (2) above to vary (otherwise than by deleting a requirement) a restriction of liberty order, it shall issue a citation requiring the offender to appear before the court and section 245A(4) shall apply to the variation of such an order as it applies to the making of an order; and b exercise the power conferred by subsection (2)(b) above to revoke such an order and deal with the offender under section 245G of this Act, it shall issue a citation requiring him to appear before the court. 4 If an offender fails to appear before the court after having been cited in accordance with subsection (3) above, the court may issue a warrant for his arrest.  Breach of restriction of liberty order. 245F 1 If at any time when a restriction of liberty order is in force it appears to the court which made the order that the offender has failed to comply with any of the requirements of the order the court may issue a citation requiring the offender to appear before the court at such time as may be specified in the citation or, if it appears to the court to be appropriate, it may issue a warrant for the arrest of the offender. 2 If it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the offender has failed without reasonable excuse to comply with any of the requirements of the order the court may by order\u2014 a without prejudice to the continuance in force of the order, impose a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale; b vary the restriction of liberty order; or c revoke that order. 3 A fine imposed under this section in respect of a failure to comply with the requirements of a restriction of liberty order shall be deemed for the purposes of any enactment to be a sum adjudged to be paid by or in respect of a conviction or a penalty imposed on a person summarily convicted. 4 Where the court varies a restriction of liberty order under subsection (2) above it may do so in any of the ways mentioned in paragraph (a) of section 245E(2) of this Act.  Disposal on revocation of restriction of liberty order. 245G 1 Where the court revokes a restriction of liberty order under section 245E(2)(b) or 245F(2) of this Act, it may dispose of the offender in any way which would have been competent at the time when the order was made, but in so doing the court shall have regard to the time for which the order has been in operation. 2 Where the court revokes a restriction of liberty order as mentioned in subsection (1) above, and the offender is, by virtue of section 245D(1) of this Act, subject to a probation order, it shall, before disposing of the offender under subsection (1) above, discharge the probation order.  Documentary evidence in proceedings under section 245F. 245H 1 Evidence of the presence or absence of the offender at a particular place at a particular time may, subject to the provisions of this section, be given by the production of a document or documents bearing to be\u2014 a a statement automatically produced by a device specified in regulations made under section 245C of this Act, by which the offender\u2019s whereabouts were remotely monitored; and b a certificate signed by a person nominated for the purpose of this paragraph by the Secretary of State that the statement relates to the whereabouts of the person subject to the order at the dates and times shown in the statement. 2 The statement and certificate mentioned in subsection (1) above shall, when produced at a hearing, be sufficient evidence of the facts set out in them. 3 Neither the statement nor the certificate mentioned in subsection (1) above shall be admissible in evidence unless a copy of both has been served on the offender prior to the hearing and, without prejudice to the foregoing, where it appears to the court that the offender has had insufficient notice of the statement or certificate, it may adjourn a hearing or make any order which it thinks appropriate in the circumstances.  Procedure on variation or revocation of restriction of liberty order. 245I Where a court exercises any power conferred by sections 232(3A), 245E(2) or 245F(2)(b) or (c) of this Act, the clerk of the court shall forthwith give copies of the order varying or revoking the restriction of liberty order to any person responsible for monitoring the offender\u2019s compliance with that order and that person shall give a copy of the order to the offender. ."}, {"act": "Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997", "year": 1997, "section": "6", "section_title": " Disposal in cases of mentally disordered offenders.", "section_text": "6 1 After section 59 of the 1995 Act (restriction orders), there shall be inserted the following section\u2014  Hospital directions. 59A 1 Subject to subsection (2) and (3) below, where a person is convicted on indictment in the High Court or in the sheriff court of an offence punishable by imprisonment, the court may, in addition to any sentence of imprisonment which it has the power or the duty to impose, by a direction under this subsection (in this Act referred to as a \u201chospital direction\u201d) authorise his admission to and detention in such hospital as may be specified in the direction. 2 Subsection (1) above shall not apply where the person convicted is a child. 3 A hospital direction shall not be made unless\u2014 a the court is satisfied on the written or oral evidence of two medical practitioners (complying with section 61 of this Act) that the grounds set out in section 17(1) of the  Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 apply in relation to the offender;
