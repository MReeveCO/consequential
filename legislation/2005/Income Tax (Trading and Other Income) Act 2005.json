return is to be increased by an amount equal to the amount on which tax would be charged under this Chapter in respect of the relevant stock dividend income disregarding any double taxation relief arrangements. 4 But the notional  UK  tax on that relevant stock dividend income is to be allowed as a credit against the individual's liability to income tax for the year of return under Step 6 of the calculation in section 23. 5 If the arising year is the year of return, the tax charged under this Chapter in respect of the relevant stock dividend income is to be charged and assessed without regard to the existence of double taxation relief arrangements. 6 Stock dividend income is  \u201crelevant stock dividend income\u201d if\u2014 a the  UK  resident company that issues the share capital or bonus share capital is a close company, and b the individual is beneficially entitled to that share capital or bonus share capital by virtue of being at a relevant time\u2014 i a material participator in the company, or ii an associate of a material participator in the company. 7 But stock dividend income within subsection (6) is not  \u201crelevant stock dividend income\u201d to the extent that the share capital or bonus share capital is issued in respect of post-departure trade profits. 8 \u201cPost-departure trade profits\u201d are\u2014 a trade profits of the close company arising in an accounting period that begins after the start of the temporary period of non-residence, and b so much of any trade profits of the close company arising in an accounting period that straddles the start of that temporary period as is attributable (on a just and reasonable basis) to a time after the start of that temporary period. 9 The extent to which share capital or bonus share capital is issued in respect of post-departure trade profits is to be determined on a just and reasonable basis. 10 The  \u201cnotional  UK  tax\u201d on the relevant stock dividend income is so much of the income tax paid by the individual for the arising year as is attributable on a just and reasonable basis to that income. 11 In this section\u2014 \u201c associate \u201d and  \u201c participator \u201d have the same meanings as in Part 10 of CTA 2010 (see sections 448 and 454); \u201c material participator \u201d means a participator who has a material interest in the company, as

that year, or any time in one or more of the 3 tax years preceding that year; \u201c trade profits of the close company \u201d means the profits of any trade carried on by the close company, as

which tax would have been charged under this Chapter applying the assumptions in subsection (4), but b in determining that amount, section 528 must be applied ignoring those assumptions. 6 That amount

not the individual) is liable for tax under this Chapter (including by virtue of this section) in respect of any gain resulting from the terminal event. 9 Nothing in any double taxation relief arrangements is to be read as preventing the individual from being liable for tax under this Chapter in respect of any gain in respect of which the individual is liable for tax by virtue of subsection (2) (or as preventing a charge to tax on that gain from arising under this Chapter). 10 Part 4 of Schedule 45 to FA 2013 (statutory residence test: anti-avoidance) explains\u2014 a when an individual

If the individual is a Scottish taxpayer  or a Welsh taxpayer , instead of Step 3 carry out Steps 3A and 3B.   Step 1 Attribute to the amount of the deficiency an amount of the individual's income for the tax year which is liable at the dividend upper rate, so far as is possible. ...

Step 3A  If there is an amount of deficiency remaining after Step 1, attribute to the remaining amount of the deficiency an amount of the individual\u2019s income for the tax year which  (in the case of a Scottish taxpayer)   is liable at the higher of the Scottish higher rate   and the savings higher rate or (in the case of a Welsh taxpayer) is liable at the higher of the Welsh higher rate and the savings higher rate , so far as is possible.

Step 4 Calculate the amount of the individual's preliminary income tax liability for the tax year (see subsection (6)). Step 5 Calculate the amount of the individual's preliminary income tax liability for the tax year again, on these assumptions\u2014 Assume that any income attributed to the deficiency at Step 1 is liable at the dividend ordinary rate. ...   Assume that any income liable at the higher rate  , or at the default higher rate or the savings higher rate  and attributed to the deficiency at Step 3, Step 3A or Step 3B is liable at the basic rate . Assume that any income liable at the Scottish higher rate  , or at the Welsh higher rate   and attributed to the deficiency at Step 3A or Step 3B is liable at the Scottish basic rate  or (as the case may be) the Welsh basic rate .
