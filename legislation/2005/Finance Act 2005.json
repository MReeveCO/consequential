Tax relief on acquisition Market value on acquisition 452 1 For the relevant tax purposes the market value of the shares (or interest in shares) at the time of the acquisition is to be calculated disregarding the effect on that market value of the intellectual property agreement and any transfer of intellectual property pursuant to it. 2 For the purposes of subsection (1)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cthe relevant tax purposes\u201d are\u2014 a determining any amount that is to constitute earnings from the employment under Chapter 1 of Part 3 (earnings), b determining the amount of any gain realised on the occurrence of an event that is a chargeable event by virtue of section 439(3)(a)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(conversion), c operating Chapter 3C of this Part (acquisition of securities for less than market value), and d determining any amount that counts as employment income of the employee under Chapter 5 of this Part (securities acquired pursuant to securities option). Tax relief following acquisition Taxable amount under Chapter 4 453 1 If the shares are (or interest in shares is) acquired before the intellectual property agreement is made, or before any transfer of intellectual property pursuant to it, and any benefit deriving from the intellectual property agreement or any such transfer is received by the employee in connection with the shares (or interest in shares), the taxable amount determined under section 448 (post-acquisition benefits from securities: amount of charge) is to be treated as nil. 2 But this section does not apply if something which affects the shares (or interest in shares) has been done (at or before the time when the intellectual property agreement is made or intellectual property is transferred) as part of a scheme or arrangement the main purpose (or one of the main purposes) of which is the avoidance of tax or national insurance contributions. Disapplication of Chapters 2 and 3B Deemed election for disapplication of Chapter 2 454 1 If the shares are restricted securities (or the interest in shares is a restricted interest in securities), the employer and the employee are to be treated as making an election under section 431(1)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(election for disapplication of Chapter 2) in relation to the shares (or interest in shares). 2 But the employer and the employee may agree that subsection (1) is not to apply in relation to the shares (or interest in shares). 3 An agreement under subsection (2) is irrevocable and\u2014 a must be made in a form approved by the Board of the Inland Revenue, and b may not be made more than 14 days after the acquisition. 4 If the employer and the employee make an agreement under subsection (2) in relation to the shares (or interest in shares), subsection (5) applies for the purposes of determining the taxable amount for the purposes of section 426 (charge on occurrence of chargeable event) on the occurrence on any chargeable event in relation to the shares (or interest in shares). 5 In determining under section 428(3)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(amount of charge) what would have been the market value of the shares (or interest in shares) at the time of the acquisition but for any restrictions (IUMV), that market value is to be calculated disregarding the effect on that market value of the intellectual property agreement and any transfer of intellectual property pursuant to it. Disapplication of Chapter 3B 455 For the purposes of Chapter 3B (securities with artificially enhanced market value) neither the intellectual property agreement nor any transfer of intellectual property pursuant to it are things done otherwise than for genuine commercial purposes. Supplementary Meaning of  \u201cintellectual property\u201d and  \u201ctransfer\u201d 456 1 In this Chapter  \u201c intellectual property \u201d means\u2014 a any patent, trade mark, registered design, copyright or design right, plant breeders' rights or rights under section 7 of the Plant Varieties Act 1997, b any right under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom corresponding to, or similar to, a right within paragraph (a), c any information or technique not protected by a right within paragraph (a) or (b) but having industrial, commercial or other economic value, d any licence or other right in respect of anything within paragraph (a), (b) or (c), or e any goodwill (having the meaning that it has for accounting purposes) associated with anything within paragraphs (a) to (d). 2 The Treasury may by order amend the definition of  \u201cintellectual property\u201d in subsection (1). 3 For the purposes of this Chapter a transfer of intellectual property includes\u2014 a a sale of the intellectual property, b the grant of a licence or other right in respect of it, and c the assignment of a licence or other right in respect of it.

Meaning of  \u201cinvolved in research\u201d 458 For the purposes of this Chapter a person is involved in research in relation to any intellectual property transferred or to be transferred from one or more research institutions if\u2014 a he has been actively engaged for the research institution (or any of them) in connection with research (whether as an employee or otherwise), and b that research is relevant to anything to which the intellectual property relates. Transfer of intellectual property by controlled company 459 1 For the purposes of this Chapter where a research institution has control of a company, a transfer of intellectual property from the company is to be treated as a transfer from the research institution. 2 For the purposes of this Chapter where two or more research institutions together have control of a company, a transfer of intellectual property from the company is to be treated as a transfer from those research institutions. 3 In this section  \u201c control \u201d means control within the meaning of section 416 of ICTA.
