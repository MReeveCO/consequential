right and without interruption for a full period of 20 years, the way is to be deemed to have been dedicated as a highway unless there is sufficient evidence that there was no intention during that period to dedicate it. 1A Subsection (1)\u2014 a is subject to section 66 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (dedication by virtue of use for mechanically propelled vehicles no longer possible), but b applies in relation to the dedication of a restricted byway by virtue of use for non-mechanically propelled vehicles as it applies in relation to the dedication of any other description of highway which does not include a public right of way for mechanically propelled vehicles. 2 The period of 20 years referred to in subsection (1) above is to be calculated retrospectively from the date when the right of the public to use the way is brought into question, whether by a notice such as is mentioned in subsection (3) below or otherwise. 3 Where the owner of

intention to dedicate the way as a highway. 4 In the case of land in the possession of a tenant for a term of years, or from year to year, any person for the time being entitled in reversion to the land shall, notwithstanding the existence of the tenancy, have the right to place and maintain such a notice as is mentioned in subsection (3) above, so, however, that no injury is done thereby to the business or occupation of the tenant. 5 Where a notice erected as mentioned in subsection (3) above is subsequently torn down or defaced, a notice given by the owner of the land to the appropriate council that the way is not dedicated as a highway is, in the absence of proof of a contrary intention, sufficient evidence to negative the intention of the owner of the land to dedicate the way as a highway. 6 An owner of land may at any time deposit with the appropriate council\u2014 a a map of the land  ..., and b a statement indicating what ways (if any) over the land he admits to have been dedicated as highways; and, in any case in which such a deposit has been made, ... declarations in valid form  made by that owner or by his successors in title and lodged by him or them with the

highway since the date of the deposit, or since the date of the lodgment of such previous declaration, as the case may be, are, in the absence of proof of a contrary intention, sufficient evidence to negative the intention of the owner or his successors in title to dedicate any such additional way as a highway. 6A Where the land is in England\u2014 a a map deposited under subsection (6)(a) and a statement deposited under subsection (6)(b) must be in the prescribed form, b a declaration is in valid form for the purposes of subsection (6) if it is in the prescribed form, and c the relevant

sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of subsection (6) is 10 years. 6C Where, under subsection (6), an owner of land in England deposits a map and statement or lodges a declaration, the appropriate council
