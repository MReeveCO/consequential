Election in relation to scheme to apply to associated schemes   103KFB    1   Where an election has been made under section  103KFA  in relation to an investment scheme (\u201c S \u201d) that is associated with another investment scheme, the election applies in respect of the other scheme (whether or not the conditions for an election to be made in respect of the other scheme were met at that time).     2   \u201c Associated \u201d, in relation to two or more investments schemes, is to be construed in accordance with section 809FZZ of ITA 2007.        Interaction with other charges   103KFC    1   The accrual of a chargeable gain treated as accruing to an individual under section  103KFA (3)  does not prevent the individual or any other person being charged to tax (whether income tax, capital gains tax or any other tax, and including as a result of section 103KA) in relation to carried interest that arises to the individual under arrangements with the relevant scheme.     2   But  subsection (3)  applies where an individual\u2014   a   has made an election under section  103KFA ,     b   has accrued a chargeable gain treated as accruing under section  103KFA (3) ,     c   has paid (and has not been repaid) an amount of capital gains tax that is attributable to that chargeable gain, and     d   is charged to tax (whether income tax, capital gains tax or another tax) in relation to carried interest that\u2014   i   arises to the individual under arrangements with the relevant scheme, and     ii   arises in or after the tax year in which a gain first accrued under that section.         3   The individual may make a claim for one or more consequential adjustments to be made reducing the tax mentioned in subsection  (2) (d) .     4   On a claim under subsection  (3)  an officer of Revenue and Customs must make such of the consequential adjustments claimed (if any) as are just and reasonable.     5   The value of any consequential adjustments made must not exceed the lesser of\u2014   a   the amount of capital gains tax paid as mentioned in subsection  (2) (c) , and     b   the tax charged as mentioned in subsection  (2) (d) .       6   Consequential adjustments may be made\u2014   a   in respect of any period, and     b   by way of an assessment, the modification of an assessment, the amendment of a claim, or otherwise.       7   No claim may be made under section 103KE (carried interest: avoidance of double taxation) in respect of tax charged as a result of the accrual of a chargeable gain treated as accruing to an individual under section  103KFA (3) .        Deemed accrual of loss where carried interest never arises   103KFD    1   Subsection  (3)  applies where\u2014   a   an individual has made an election under section  103KFA ,     b   the individual has accrued a chargeable gain treated as accruing under section  103KFA (3) , and     c   the conditions in subsection  (2)  are met.       2   Those conditions are that\u2014   a   all, or substantially all, of the investments of the relevant scheme have been disposed of,     b   the amount of carried interest that has arisen to the individual in respect of the relevant scheme since the beginning of the first tax year in which a gain is treated as accruing under section  103KFA (3)  is less than the sum of chargeable gains treated as accruing to the individual under that section, and     c   no further amount of carried interest can reasonably be expected to arise to the individual under arrangements with the relevant scheme.       3   The individual is to be treated as accruing a loss immediately before the end of the tax year in which the conditions in subsection  (2)  are first met.     4   The amount of that loss is the amount given by subtracting\u2014   a   the amount of carried interest that arose to the individual in respect of the relevant scheme since the beginning of the first tax year in which a gain is treated as accruing under section  103KFA (3) , from     b   the sum of the chargeable gains that have accrued under section  103KFA (3)  (including any gain that accrues in respect of the tax year in which the loss accrues).       5   Where a loss has accrued to an individual as a result of  subsection (3) \u2014   a   section 103KFA (3)  does not apply (in relation to the individual and the relevant scheme) for any tax year after the tax year in which the loss accrued, and     b   if carried interest arises to the individual in respect of the relevant scheme after the loss accrued, the individual may not make a claim under  section 103KFC (3)  in respect of tax charged in relation to it.          Anti-avoidance   103KFE    1   This section applies where an election was made by an individual under section  103KFA  and the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of making the election is to cause a loss to be treated as accruing to the individual under subsection  (3)  of section  103KFD .     2   Any such loss that would (in the absence of this section) accrue to the individual under that subsection is to be counteracted by the making of such adjustments as are just and reasonable.     3   Any adjustments required to be made under this section (whether or not by an officer of Revenue and Customs) may be made by way of\u2014   a   an assessment,     b   the modification of an assessment, or     c   amendment or disallowance of a claim, or otherwise.             3   In section 1H (the main rates of CGT), in subsection (9)\u2014   a   omit the \u201cor\u201d at the end of paragraph (a), and     b   after that paragraph insert\u2014    aa   under section  103KFA (3)  (gains on deemed carried interest where election made), or     .       4   The amendments made by this section have effect for the tax year 2022-23 and subsequent tax years.

Step 2 (determine the maximum amount of receipts that would not be exceptional)  Multiply the amount of electricity generation (expressed in megawatt hours) attributed to the undertaking for the period (see  section 282 ) by the benchmark amount (see  section 281 ).      Step 3 (determine whether undertaking has receipts that exceed that amount)  Subtract the result of Step 2 from the amount determined under Step 1.

Step 4 (subtract allowable costs)  Determine the amount of allowable costs (if any) to be attributed to the undertaking for the period (see  section 284 ) and subtract that amount from the result of Step 3.
