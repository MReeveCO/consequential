public shall be excluded from a meeting of a principal council during an item of business whenever it is likely, in view of the nature of the business to be transacted or the nature of the proceedings, that, if members of the public were present during that item, confidential information would be disclosed to them in breach of the obligation of confidence; and nothing in this Part shall be taken to authorise or require the disclosure of confidential information in breach of the obligation of confidence. 3 For the purposes of subsection (2) above, \u201c confidential information \u201d means\u2014 a information furnished to the council by a Government department upon terms (however expressed) which forbid the disclosure of the information to the public; and b information the

proceedings, that if members of the public were present during that item there would be disclosure to them of exempt information, as defined in section 100I below. 5 A resolution under subsection (4) above shall\u2014 a identify the proceedings, or the part of the proceedings, to which it applies, and b state the description, in terms of Schedule 12A to this Act, of the exempt information giving rise to the exclusion of the public, and where such a resolution is passed this section does not require the meeting to be open to the public during proceedings to which the resolution applies. 5A

council shall not have power to exclude members of the public from the meeting; and c   subject to subsection (7D),  while the meeting is open to the public, duly accredited representatives of newspapers attending the meeting for the purpose of reporting the proceedings for those newspapers shall, so far as practicable, be afforded reasonable facilities for taking their report and, unless the meeting is held in premises not belonging to the council or not on the telephone, for telephoning the report at their own expense. 7   Subject to subsection (7A)  nothing in this section shall require a principal council to permit the taking of photographs of any proceedings, or the use of any means to enable persons not present to see or hear any proceedings (whether at the time or later),

the meeting. 7B Subsection (7A) does not require a principal council in England to permit oral reporting or oral commentary on a meeting as it takes place if the person reporting or providing the commentary is present at the meeting. 7C A person attending a meeting of a principal council in England for the purpose of reporting on the meeting must, so far as practicable, be afforded reasonable facilities for doing so. 7D Subsection (7C) applies in place of subsection (6)(c) in the case of a principal council in England. 7E Any person who attends a meeting of a principal council in England for the purpose of reporting on the meeting may use any communication method, including the internet, to publish, post or otherwise share the results of the person\u2019s reporting activities. 7F

conduct or other misbehaviour at a meeting. 9 In this section \u201creporting\u201d means\u2014 a filming, photographing or making an audio recording of proceedings at a meeting, b using any other
