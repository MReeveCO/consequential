but any condition of a licence specified by virtue of subsection (6) of this section may not be revoked and any condition specified by virtue of paragraph (a)(ii) of that subsection may not be varied. 10 Where a local authority varies a licence under subsection (9) of this section, then\u2014 a if the variation was requested by the person to whom the licence was granted, the variation shall take effect immediately after the authority decides to make it;
