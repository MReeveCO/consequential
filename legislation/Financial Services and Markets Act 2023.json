Power of censure   312Q   If a relevant regulator considers that a critical third party has contravened a requirement imposed by or under this Chapter the regulator may publish a statement to that effect.      Disciplinary measures   312R    1   This section applies if a relevant regulator considers that a critical third party has contravened a requirement imposed by or under this Chapter.     2   The relevant regulator may publish a notice\u2014   a   prohibiting the critical third party from entering into arrangements, or continuing, to provide services to authorised persons, relevant service providers or FMI entities;     b   prohibiting authorised persons, relevant service providers or FMI entities who receive services from the critical third party from continuing to receive those services from that party;     c   prohibiting authorised persons, relevant service providers or FMI entities from entering into arrangements for receipt of services from the critical third party;     d   providing for the provision of any services by the critical third party to be subject to such conditions or limitations as are specified in the notice;     e   providing for any receipt of services by authorised persons, relevant service providers or FMI entities from the critical third party to be subject to such conditions or limitations as are specified in the notice.       3   A notice under subsection (2) may make different provision for different cases and may in particular make different provision in respect of different descriptions of services, authorised persons, FMI entities or relevant service providers.     4   A relevant regulator may only exercise the powers under subsection (2) if the regulator is satisfied that\u2014   a   it is appropriate in the circumstances to take action against the critical third party,     b   the exercise of the power will not threaten the stability of, or confidence in, the UK financial system, and     c   it is desirable to exercise the power in order to advance one or more of the regulator\u2019s objectives.       5   A relevant regulator may either on its own initiative or on an application by the critical third party concerned withdraw or vary a notice given by it under subsection (2) by publishing a further notice.     6   Publication under this section is to be made in such manner as the relevant regulator considers best designed to bring the publication to the attention of the public.     7   Where a notice includes a prohibition, condition or limitation imposed under subsection (2), publication of a notice under this section must in particular be made in a manner appearing to the relevant regulator to be best designed to bring the notice to the attention of the persons to whom the prohibition, condition or limitation applies.     8   A person who breaches a prohibition, condition or limitation imposed by a notice under this section is to be taken to have contravened a requirement imposed on the person under this Act.     9   For the purposes of this section the objectives of a relevant regulator are as described in section 312M(2).        Procedure and right to refer to Tribunal   312S    1   If a relevant regulator proposes to publish a statement or notice under section 312Q or 312R, it must give the critical third party, authorised persons, relevant service providers or FMI entities to whom the statement or notice would relate a warning notice.     2   A warning notice must set out the terms of the proposed statement or notice.     3   If a relevant regulator decides to publish a statement or notice under section 312Q or 312R it must give the critical third party, authorised persons, relevant service providers or FMI entities to whom the statement or notice relates a decision notice.     4   A decision notice must set out the terms of the statement or notice.     5   If a relevant regulator decides to act under section 312N or 312Q a critical third party who is aggrieved may refer the matter to the Tribunal.     6   If a relevant regulator decides to act under section 312R a critical third party, authorised person, relevant service provider or FMI entity who is aggrieved may refer the matter to the Tribunal.        Statement of policy relating to disciplinary measures   312T    1   The relevant regulators must prepare and publish a statement of policy with respect to the exercise of powers under section 312Q and section 312R.     2   The relevant regulators may alter or replace a statement published under this section.     3   The relevant regulators must publish a statement as altered or replaced under subsection (2).     4   Publication under this section is to be made in such manner as the relevant regulators consider best designed to bring the publication to the attention of the public.        Duty to ensure co-ordinated exercise of functions etc   312U    1   The relevant regulators must co-ordinate the exercise of their respective functions conferred by or under this Chapter.     2   In complying with the duty in subsection (1) each relevant regulator must obtain information and advice from any of the other relevant regulators who may be expected to have relevant information or relevant expertise.     3   The duty in subsection (1) applies only to the extent that compliance with the duty does not impose a burden on the relevant regulators that is disproportionate to the benefits of compliance.     4   Before exercising any power conferred by or under this Chapter a relevant regulator must consult each of the other relevant regulators (where not otherwise required to do so).        Memorandum of understanding   312V    1   The relevant regulators must prepare and maintain a memorandum which describes in general terms\u2014   a   the role of the relevant regulators in relation to the exercise of functions conferred by or under this Chapter, and     b   how they intend to comply with section 312U in relation to the exercise of such functions.       2   The relevant regulators must review the memorandum at least once in each calendar year.     3   The relevant regulators may revise a memorandum under this section.     4   The relevant regulators must give the Treasury a copy of the memorandum and any revised memorandum.     5   The Treasury must lay before Parliament a copy of any document received by them under this section.     6   The relevant regulators must ensure that the memorandum as in force for the time being is published in the way appearing to them to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public.     7   The memorandum need not relate to any aspect of compliance with section 312U if the relevant regulators consider\u2014   a   that publication of information about that aspect would be against the public interest, or     b   that aspect is a technical or operational matter not affecting the public.          Application of provisions of this Act to this Chapter   312W   The following provisions do not apply for the purposes of this Chapter\u2014   a   section 3D (duty to ensure co-ordinated exercise of functions);     b   section 3E (memorandum of understanding);     c   section 138D (actions for damages).
