 and where such a resolution is passed, this Act shall not require the meeting to be open to the public during proceedings to which the resolution applies . 3 A body may under subsection (2) above treat the need to receive or consider recommendations or advice from sources other than members, committees or sub-committees of the body as a special reason why publicity would be prejudicial to the public interest, without regard to the subject or purport of the recommendations or advice; but the making by this subsection of express provision for that case shall not be taken to restrict the generality of subsection (2) above in relation to other cases (including in particular cases where the report of a committee or sub-committee of the body is of a confidential nature). 3A Where the public are excluded from a meeting of a relevant local government body under subsection (2), the body may also prevent any person from reporting on the meeting using methods\u2014 a which can be used without that person\u2019s presence at the meeting, and b which enable persons not present at the meeting to see or hear the proceedings at the meeting as it takes place or later. 4 Where a meeting of a body is required by this Act to be open to the public during the proceedings or any part of them, the following provisions shall apply, that is to say,\u2014   The following provisions apply in relation to a meeting of a body\u2014   a public notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be given by posting it at the offices of the body (or, if the body has no offices, then in some central and conspicuous place in the area with which it is concerned) three clear days at least before the meeting or, if the meeting is convened at shorter notice, then at the time it is convened; public notice of the time of the meeting and, if the meeting is to be open to the public, how to access the meeting, must be given by publishing it electronically at least three clear days before the meeting or, if the meeting is convened at shorter notice, then as soon as reasonably practicable;

the agenda for the meeting as supplied to members of the body must also be published electronically in advance of the meeting (but excluding, if thought fit, any relevant item), together with such further statements or particulars, if any, as are necessary to indicate the nature of the items included or, if thought fit in the case of any item, any reports or other documents supplied to members of the body in connection with the item; c while the meeting is open to the public, the body shall not have power to exclude members of the public from the meeting  and duly accredited representatives of newspapers attending for the purpose of reporting the proceedings for those newspapers shall, so far as practicable, be afforded reasonable facilities for taking their report and, unless the meeting is held in premises not belonging to the body or not on the telephone, for telephoning the report at their own expense    ;
