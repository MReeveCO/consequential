or b in relation to anything authorised to be done by or in relation to that authority, a reference to either or both of the authorities concerned (or, in the context  ...  or of section 64(4) or (6) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 , to both of them acting together). 5 For the purposes of this Act children are to be regarded as admitted to a school for nursery education if\u2014 a in the case of a school in England, they are admitted for early years provision as defined by section 20 of the Childcare Act 2006 and are not, or are not to be, placed on admission in a reception class or any more senior class, and b in the case of a school in Wales, if they are, or are to be, placed on admission in a nursery class. 6 For the purposes of this Act references to disposing of land include references to\u2014 a granting or disposing of any interest in land; b entering into a contract to dispose of land or to grant or dispose of any such interest; and c granting an option to purchase any land or any such interest. 7 For the purposes of this Act\u2014 a a person employed by a   local authority   is to be regarded as employed to work at a school if his employment with the authority for the time being involves work at that school; and b a person employed by a   local authority   is to be regarded as employed to work solely at a school if his only employment with the authority (disregarding any employment under a separate contract with the authority) is for the time being at that school. 8 This Act shall be construed as one with the  Education Act 1996; and (without prejudice to their generality) paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedule 39 to that Act (construction of references etc.) apply to references in this Act to provisions of that Act. 9 Where, however, an expression is given for the purposes of any provision of this Act a meaning different from that given to it for the purposes of that Act, the meaning given for the purposes of that provision shall apply instead of the one given for the purposes of that Act. 10 Subsection (1) of section 576 of that Act (meaning of \u201cparent\u201d) shall, in its application for the purposes of\u2014 a section 43 or 62(2) of this Act, or b paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 or paragraph 4 or 14 of Schedule 9 to this Act, be taken as referring only to persons within paragraph (a) or (b) of that subsection who are individuals."}, {"act": "School Standards and Framework Act 1998", "year": 1998, "section": "143", "section_title": " Index.", "section_text": "143 The expressions listed in the left-hand column below are defined by, or (as the case may be) are to be interpreted in accordance with, the provisions of this Act listed in the right-hand column in relation to those expressions.
