current arrangements for taking the witness\u2019s evidence include the use of a special measure or combination of special measures authorised by an order under section 271A or 271C of this Act or

measures so authorised. 3A If an earlier order has the effect of enabling all of the witness's evidence to be given in advance of the hearing, the court may not make an order under subsection (2)(a)

witness to be present in the courtroom), and c it does not authorise the giving of any of the witness's evidence without the benefit of any special measure. 4 The court may make an order under subsection (2)(a) above revoking an earlier order only if satisfied\u2014 a where the witness has expressed a wish to give or, as the case may be, continue to give evidence without the benefit of any
