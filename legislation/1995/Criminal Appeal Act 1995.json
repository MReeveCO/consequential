do so; and it is hereby declared that this power extends to replacing a sentence or order which for any reason appears to be invalid by another which the court has power to impose or make. 2 The power conferred on a magistrates\u2019 court by paragraph (1) shall not be exercisable in relation to any sentence or order imposed or made by it when dealing with an offender if\u2014 a the county court
