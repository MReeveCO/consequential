child\u2019s family home any person named in the order (in this Part of this Act referred to as the \u201c named person \u201d). 2 The conditions are\u2014 a that the child has suffered, is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm as a result of any conduct, or any threatened or reasonably apprehended conduct, of the named person; b that the making of an exclusion order against the named person\u2014 i is necessary for the protection of the child, irrespective of whether the child is for the time being residing in the family home; and ii would better safeguard the child\u2019s welfare than the removal of the child from the family home; and c that, if an order is made, there will be a person specified in the application who is capable of taking responsibility for the provision of appropriate care for the child and any other member of the family who requires such care and who is, or will be, residing in the family home (in this section, sections 77 to 79and section 91(3)(f) of this Act referred to as an \u201c appropriate person \u201d). 3 No application under subsection (1) above for an exclusion order shall be finally determined under this section unless\u2014 a the named person has been afforded an opportunity of being heard by, or represented before, the sheriff; and b the sheriff has considered any views expressed by any person on whom notice of the application has been served in accordance with rules making such provision as is mentioned in section 91(3)(d) of this Act. 4 Where, on an application under subsection (1) above, the sheriff\u2014 a is satisfied as mentioned in that subsection; but b the conditions mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (3) above for the final determination of the application are not fulfilled, he may grant an interim order, which shall have effect as an exclusion order pending a hearing by the sheriff under subsection (5) below held within such period as may be specified in rules made by virtue of section 91(3)(e) of this Act. 5 The sheriff shall conduct a hearing under this subsection within such period as may be specified in rules made by virtue of section 91(3)(e) of this Act, and, if satisfied at that hearing as mentioned in subsection (1) above, he may, before finally determining the application, confirm or vary the interim order, or any term or condition on which it was granted, or may recall

make   a child protection order   as if the application had been duly made by the local authority under that  Part  rather than under this section. 9 The sheriff shall not make an exclusion order if

matters specified in subsection (10) below; and b any requirement such as is specified in subsection (11) below and the likely consequences in the light of that requirement of the exclusion of the named person from the family home. 10 The matters referred to in subsection (9)(a) above are\u2014 a the conduct of the members of the child\u2019s family (whether in relation to each other or otherwise); b the respective needs and financial resources of the members of that family; c the extent (if any) to which\u2014 i the family home; and ii any relevant item in that home, is used in connection with a trade, business or profession by any member of the family. 11 The requirement referred to in subsection (9)(b) above is a requirement that the named person (whether alone or with any other person) must reside in the family home, where that home\u2014 a is on or comprised in a lease constituting a 1991 Act tenancy within the meaning of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003

includes any garden or other ground or building attached to and usually occupied with, or otherwise required for the amenity or convenience of, the house, caravan, houseboat or other structure. 13 The description of person referred to in the definition of \u201cfamily home\u201d in subsection (12) above, is a person who has parental responsibilities in relation to the child, or who ordinarily (and
