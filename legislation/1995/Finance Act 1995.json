and b is still such a trust at the time of the disposal, shall not be a chargeable gain or, as the case may be, an allowable loss. 2 For the purposes of this section a disposal of shares is a

disposal by any person of shares in a venture capital trust relates to shares acquired in excess of the permitted maximum for any year of assessment, it shall be assumed (subject to subsection (5) below)\u2014 a as between shares acquired by the same person on different days, that those acquired on an earlier day are disposed of by that person before those acquired on a later day; and b as between shares acquired by the same person on the same day, that those acquired in excess of the permitted maximum are disposed of by that person before he disposes of any other shares acquired on that day. 5 It shall be assumed for the purposes of subsection (1) above that a person who disposes of shares in a venture capital trust disposes of shares acquired at a time when it was not such a trust before he disposes of any other shares in that trust. 6 References in this section to shares in a venture capital trust acquired in excess of the permitted maximum for any year of assessment shall be construed in accordance with the provisions of Part II of Schedule 15B to the Taxes Act; and the provisions of that Part of that Schedule shall apply (with subsections (4) and (5) above) for identifying the shares which are, in any case, to be treated as representing shares acquired in excess of the permitted maximum. 7 In this section and section 151B \u201c ordinary shares \u201d, in

b any shares in a venture capital trust which are eligible for relief under section 151A(1) but by reference to which no person has been given, or is entitled to claim, any relief under that Part of that Schedule; c any shares in a venture capital trust by reference to which any person has been given, or is entitled to claim, any relief under that Part of that Schedule but which are not shares that are eligible for relief under section 151A(1); and d any shares in a venture capital trust that do not fall within any of paragraphs (a) to (c) above. 4 Where\u2014 a an individual holds ordinary shares in a company (\u201cthe existing holding\u201d), b there is, by virtue of any such allotment for payment as is mentioned in section 126(2)(a), a reorganisation affecting the existing holding, and c immediately following the reorganisation, the shares or the allotted holding are shares falling within any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (3) above, sections 127 to 130 shall not apply in relation to the existing holding. 5 Sections 135 and 136 shall not apply where\u2014 a the exchanged holding consists of shares falling within paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (3) above; and b that for which the exchanged holding is or is treated as exchanged does not consist of ordinary shares in a venture capital trust. 6 Where\u2014 a the approval of any company as a venture capital trust is withdrawn, and b the withdrawal of the approval is not one to which section 842AA(8) of the Taxes Act applies, any person who at the time when the withdrawal takes effect is holding shares in that company which (apart from the withdrawal) would be eligible for relief under section 151A(1) shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act, at that time, to have disposed of and immediately re-acquired those shares for a consideration equal to their market value at that time. 7 The disposal that is deemed to take place by virtue of subsection (6) above shall be deemed for the purposes of section 151A to take place while the company is still a venture capital trust; but, for the purpose of applying sections 104, 105 and 107 to the shares that are deemed to be re-acquired, it shall be assumed that the re-acquisition for which that subsection provides takes place immediately after the company ceases to be such a trust. 8 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a shares are eligible for relief under section 151A(1) at any time when they are held by an individual whose disposal of the shares at that time would (on the assumption, where it is not the case, that the individual attained the age of eighteen years before that time) be a disposal to which section 151A(1) would apply; and b shares shall not, in relation to any time, be treated as shares by reference to which relief has been given under Part I of Schedule 15B to the Taxes Act if that time falls after\u2014 i any relief given by reference to those shares has been reduced or withdrawn, ii any chargeable event (within the meaning of Schedule 5C) has occurred in relation to those shares, or iii the death of a person who held those shares immediately before his death;
