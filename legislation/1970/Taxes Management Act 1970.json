tax by each such partner , and b the amount in which each partner chargeable to corporation tax for any period is so chargeable, an officer of the Board may act under subsection (2) or (3) below (or both). 1A For the purposes of subsection (1) above\u2014 a the amount in which a partner is chargeable to income tax or corporation tax is a net amount, that is to say, an amount which takes into account any relief or allowance for which a claim is made; and b the amount payable by a partner by way of income tax is the difference between the amount in which he is chargeable to income tax and the aggregate amount of any income tax deducted at source  ... 1B Where a partnership to which subsection (1) applies (\u201cthe reporting partnership\u201d) includes a partner which is itself a

reporting partnership if the person is a partner in\u2014 a a partnership which is a partner in the reporting partnership, or b any partnership which is an indirect partner in the reporting partnership by virtue of the preceding application of this subsection. 2 An officer of the Board may by a notice given to the partners require such person as is identified in accordance with rules

return containing such information as may reasonably be required in pursuance of the notice, and b to deliver with the return   such accounts, statements and documents, relating to information contained in the return,   as may reasonably be so required. 3 An officer of the Board may by notice given to any partner require the partner   or a successor of his \u2014 a to make and deliver to the officer in respect of such period as may be specified in the notice, on or before such day as may be so specified, a return containing such information as may reasonably be required in pursuance of the notice, and b to deliver with the return such accounts and statements as may reasonably be so required; and a notice may be given to any one partner or separate notices may be given to each partner or to such partners as the officer thinks fit. 4 In the case of a partnership which includes one or more individuals, a notice under subsection (2) or (3) above may specify different days depending on whether a return in respect of a year of assessment (Year 1) is electronic or non-electronic. 4A The day specified for a non-electronic return must not be earlier than 31st October of

that if the notice is given after 31st July in Year 2 (but on or before 31st October)\u2014 a the day specified for a non-electronic return must be after the end of the period of three months beginning with the date of the notice, and b the day specified for an electronic return must not be earlier than 31st January. 4E Exception 2 is that if the notice is given after 31st October in Year 2, the day specified for a return (whether or not electronic) must be after the end of the period of three months beginning with the date of the notice. 5 In the case of a partnership which includes one or more companies, a notice may specify different dates depending on whether a notice in respect of a relevant period is electronic or non-electronic. 5A The day specified for a non-electronic return must not be earlier than the end of the period of nine months beginning at the end of the relevant period. 5B The day specified for an electronic return must not be earlier than the first anniversary of the end of the relevant period. 5C But where the notice is given more than nine months after the end of the relevant period, the day specified for a return (whether or not electronic)

relevant period, or ii for any part of that period, and, in the case of a person falling within sub-paragraph (ii) above, of the part concerned; and b a declaration by the person making the return to the effect that it is to the best of his knowledge correct and complete.

purpose  \u201cthe relevant day\u201d is the day specified in relation to the failure in the following table. Failure Relevant day A failure to comply with subsection (1) or (3) of section 308 in so far as the subsection applies by virtue of an order under section 306A The first day after the end of the period prescribed under section 306A(6) A failure to comply with subsection (1) or (3) of section 308 in so far as the subsection applies by virtue of an order under section 308A(2) The first day after the end of the period prescribed under subsections (5) and (6)(a) of section 308A (as it may have been extended by a direction under subsection (6)(b) of that section) Any other failure to comply with subsection (1) of section 308 The first day after the end of the period prescribed under that subsection Any other failure to comply with subsection (3) of section 308 The first day after the end of the period prescribed under that subsection A failure to comply with subsection (1) of section 309 The first day after the end of the period prescribed under that subsection A failure to comply with section 310 The first day after the latest time by which section 310 must be complied with in the case concerned   A failure to comply with section 310A  The first day after the end of the period within which the person must comply with section 310A.   A failure to comply with section 311C  The first day after the end of the period before the end of which the person must comply with section 311C 2ZAA Subsection (2ZAB) applies where\u2014 a a person fails to comply with a provision mentioned in subsection (2)(a), (b) or (c) in respect of arrangements or proposed arrangements, and b a reference number is subsequently allocated to the arrangements or proposed arrangements in a case within section 311(3) of the Finance Act 2004 (case where notice given under section 310D)). 2ZAB Where this subsection applies, the failure to comply is taken for the purposes of this section to have ceased on the day before the reference number is allocated, if it has not already ceased. 2ZB The amount of a penalty under subsection (1)(a)(i) is to be arrived at after taking account of all relevant considerations, including the desirability of its being set at a level which appears appropriate for deterring the person, or other persons, from similar failures to comply on future occasions having regard (in particular)\u2014 a in the case of a penalty for a   promoter's   failure to comply with section 308(1) or (3)  or section 310A , to the amount of any fees received, or likely to have been received, by the   promoter   in connection with the notifiable proposal (or arrangements implementing the notifiable proposal), or with the notifiable arrangements,  aa in the case of a penalty for a person's failure to comply with section 311C, to the amount of any fees received, or likely to have been received, by the person in connection with the arrangements, the proposed arrangements or the proposal,  and b in the case of a penalty for a   relevant  person's failure to comply with section 309(1) , 310 or 310A , to the amount of any advantage gained, or sought to be gained, by the   relevant  person in relation to any tax prescribed under section 306(1)(b) in relation to the notifiable arrangements. 2ZBA In subsection (2ZB)\u2014 a \u201c promoter \u201d has the same meaning as in Part 7 of the Finance Act 2004, and b \u201c relevant person \u201d means a person who enters into any transaction forming part of notifiable arrangements within the meaning of that Part. 2ZC If the maximum penalty under subsection (1)(a)(i) above appears inappropriately low after taking account of those considerations, the penalty is to be of such amount not exceeding \u00a31 million as appears appropriate having regard to those considerations. 2ZD Where it appears to an officer of Revenue and Customs that a penalty under subsection (1)(a)(i) above has been determined on the basis that the initial period begins with a day later than that which the officer considers to be the relevant day, an officer of Revenue and Customs may commence proceedings for a re-determination of the penalty. 2ZE The Treasury may by regulations vary\u2014 a any of the sums for the time being specified in subsection (1) above, and b the sum specified in subsection (2ZC) above. 2A Where a failure to comply with a provision mentioned in subsection (2) concerns a proposal or arrangements in respect of which an order has been made under section 306A of the Finance Act 2004 (doubt as to notifiability), the   amounts specified in subsection (1)(a)(i) and (b) above shall be increased to the prescribed sum in relation to days falling after the prescribed period . 2B Where a failure to comply with a provision mentioned in subsection (2) concerns a proposal or arrangements in respect of which an order has been made under section 314A of the Finance Act 2004 (order to disclose), the   amounts specified in subsection (1)(a)(i) and (b)   above shall be increased to the prescribed sum in relation to days falling after the prescribed period. 2C In subsection (2A) and (2B)\u2014 a \u201c the prescribed sum \u201d means a sum prescribed by the Treasury by regulations, and b \u201c the prescribed period \u201d means a period beginning with the date of the order under section   306A or  314A and prescribed by the Commissioners by regulations. 2D The making of an order under section   306A or  314A of that Act does not of itself mean that, for the purposes of section 118(2) of this Act, a person either did or did not have a reasonable excuse for non-compliance before the order was made. 2E Where an order is made under section   306A or  314A of that Act then for the purposes of section 118(2) of this Act\u2014 a the person identified in the order as the promoter of the proposal or arrangements cannot, in respect of any time after the end of the period mentioned in subsection (2B), rely on doubt as to notifiability as an excuse for failure to comply with section 308 of that Act, and b any delay in compliance with that section after the end of that period is unreasonable unless attributable to something other than doubt as to notifiability. 2EA Where a person fails to comply with\u2014 a section 309 of that Act and the promoter for the purposes of that section is a monitored promoter for the purposes of Part 5 of the Finance Act 2014, or b section 310 of that Act and the arrangements for the purposes of that section are arrangements of such a monitored promoter, then for the purposes of section 118(2) of this Act legal advice which the person took into account is to be disregarded in determining whether the person had a reasonable excuse, if the advice was given or procured by that monitored promoter. 2EB In determining for the purpose of section 118(2) of this Act whether or not a person who is a monitored promoter within the meaning of Part 5 of the Finance Act 2014 had a reasonable excuse for a failure to do anything required to be done under a provision mentioned in subsection (2), reliance on legal advice is to be taken automatically not to constitute a reasonable excuse if either\u2014 a the advice was not based on a full and accurate description of the facts, or b the conclusions in the advice that the person relied on were unreasonable. 2F Regulations under   this section \u2014 a may include incidental or transitional provision, b shall be made by statutory instrument, c in the case of regulations under subsection   (2ZE) or  (2C)(a), shall not be made unless a draft has been laid before and approved by resolution of the House of Commons, and d in the case of regulations under subsection (2C)(b), shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the House of Commons. 3 A person who fails to comply with   subsection (1) of section 313   of the Finance Act 2004 (duties of parties to notifiable arrangements to notify Board of reference number,  etc. )   or regulations under subsection (3) of that section  shall be liable to a   penalty not exceeding the relevant sum . 4 In subsection (3) above  \u201c the relevant sum \u201d means\u2014 a in relation to a person not falling within paragraph (b) or (c) below,   \u00a35,000   in respect of each scheme to which the failure relates, b in relation to a person who has previously failed to comply with section   subsection (1) of section 313 or regulations under subsection (3) of that section   on one (and only one) occasion during the period of 36 months ending with the date on which the current failure to comply with that provision began,   \u00a37,500   in respect of each scheme to which the current failure relates (whether or not the same as the scheme to which the previous failure relates), or c in relation to a person who has previously failed to comply with section  subsection (1) of section 313 or regulations under subsection (3) of that section  on two or more occasions during the period of 36 months ending with the date on which the current failure to comply with that provision began,   \u00a310,000   in respect of each scheme to which the current failure relates (whether or not the same as the schemes to which any of the previous failures relates). 5 In subsection (4) above  \u201c scheme \u201d means any notifiable arrangements within the meaning of Part 7 of the Finance Act 2004."}, {"act": "Taxes Management Act 1970", "year": 1970, "section": "99", "section_title":
