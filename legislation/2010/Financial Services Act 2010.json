Short selling rules: procedure in urgent cases 131D 1 The Authority may make short selling rules (and may subsequently amend those rules) without complying with section 155 (consultation in relation to proposed rules) if it considers that it is necessary to do so, in order to\u2014 a maintain confidence in the UK financial system; or b protect the stability of the UK financial system. 2 Any rules made by virtue of subsection (1)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(\u201cemergency rules\u201d) cease to have effect at the end of the period of three months beginning with the day on which the rules are made (\u201c the relevant day \u201d); but this is subject as follows. 3 The Authority may direct that emergency rules are to cease to have effect at the end of a period (not exceeding six months beginning with the relevant day) specified in the direction. 4 A direction under subsection (3) may be made only if, immediately before the end of the period mentioned in subsection (2), the Authority considers that it is necessary to do so, in order to\u2014 a maintain confidence in the UK financial system; or b protect the stability of the UK financial system. 5 Such a direction must be published by the Authority in the way appearing to the Authority to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public. 6 Nothing in subsection (2) or (3) prevents the Authority from revoking emergency rules before the end of the periods referred to there. Power to require information Power to require information 131E 1 The Authority may, by notice in writing, require a person (\u201cP\u201d)\u2014 a to provide specified information or information of a specified description; or b to produce specified documents or documents of a specified description. 2 This section applies only to information and documents that the Authority reasonably requires for the purpose of determining whether P, or a person connected with P, has contravened any provision of short selling rules. 3 Information or documents required under this section must be provided or produced\u2014 a before the end of such reasonable period as may be specified; and b at such place as may be specified. 4 The Authority may require any information provided under this section to be provided in such form as it may reasonably require. 5 The Authority may require\u2014 a any information provided, whether in a document or otherwise, to be verified in such manner as it may reasonably require; or b any document produced to be authenticated in such manner as it may reasonably require. 6 In this section  \u201c specified \u201d means specified in the notice. 7 For the purposes of this section a person is connected with another person (\u201cP\u201d) if the person is or has at any relevant time been\u2014 a a member of P's group; b a controller of P; c any other member of a partnership of which P is a member; or d in relation to P, a person mentioned in Part 1 of Schedule 15 (reading references in that Part to the authorised person as references to P). Power to require information: supplementary 131F 1 If the Authority has power under section 131E to require a person to produce a document but it appears that the document is in the possession of a third person, that power may be exercised in relation to the third person. 2 If a document is produced in response to a requirement imposed under section 131E, the Authority may\u2014 a take copies of or extracts from the document; or b require the person producing the document, or any relevant person, to provide an explanation of the document. 3 In subsection (2)(b)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201c relevant person \u201d, in relation to a person who is required to produce a document, means a person who\u2014 a has been or is or is proposed to be a director or controller of that person; b has been or is an auditor of that person; c has been or is an actuary, accountant or lawyer appointed or instructed by that person; or d has been or is an employee of that person. 4 If a person who is required under section 131E to produce a document fails to do so, the Authority may require the person to state, to the best of the person's knowledge and belief, where the document is. 5 A lawyer may be required under section 131E to provide the name and address of the lawyer's client. 6 A person (\u201cP\u201d) may not be required under section 131E to disclose information or produce a document in respect of which P owes an obligation of confidence by virtue of carrying on the business of banking unless\u2014 a P is the person under investigation or a member of that person's group; b the person to whom the obligation of confidence is owed is the person under investigation or a member of that person\u2018s group; or c the person to whom the obligation of confidence is owed consents to the disclosure or production. 7 If a person claims a lien on a document, its production under section 131E does not affect the lien. Breach of short selling rules etc Power to impose penalty or issue censure 131G 1 This section applies if the Authority is satisfied that a person has contravened\u2014 a any provision of short selling rules; or b any requirement imposed on the person under section 131E or 131F. 2 The Authority may impose a penalty of such amount as it considers appropriate on\u2014 a the person who contravened the provision or requirement; or b any person who was knowingly concerned in the contravention. 3 It may, instead of imposing a penalty on a person, publish a statement censuring the person. 4 The Authority may not take action against a person under this section after the end of the limitation period unless, before the end of that period, it has given a warning notice to the person under section 131H. 5 \u201c The limitation period \u201d means the period of three years beginning with the first day on which the Authority knew of the contravention. 6 For this purpose the Authority is to be treated as knowing of a contravention if it has information from which the contravention can reasonably be inferred. Procedure and right to refer to Tribunal 131H 1 If the Authority proposes to take action against a person under section 131G, it must give the person a warning notice. 2 A warning notice about a proposal to impose a penalty must state the amount of the penalty. 3 A warning notice about a proposal to publish a statement must set out the terms of the statement. 4 If the Authority decides to take action against a person under section 131G, it must give the person a decision notice. 5 A decision notice about the imposition of a penalty must state the amount of the penalty. 6 A decision notice about the publication of a statement must set out the terms of the statement. 7 If the Authority decides to take action against a person under section 131G, the person may refer the matter to the Tribunal. Duty on publication of statement 131I After a statement under section 131G(3) is published, the Authority must send a copy of the statement to\u2014 a the person in respect of whom it is made; and b any person to whom a copy of the decision notice was given under section 393(4). Imposition of penalties under section 131G: statement of policy 131J 1 The Authority must prepare and issue a statement of its policy with respect to\u2014 a the imposition of penalties under section 131G; and b the amount of penalties under that section. 2 The Authority's policy in determining what the amount of a penalty should be must include having regard to\u2014 a the seriousness of the contravention; b the extent to which the contravention was deliberate or reckless; and c whether the person on whom the penalty is to be imposed is an individual. 3 The Authority may at any time alter or replace a statement issued under this section. 4 If a statement issued under this section is altered or replaced, the Authority must issue the altered or replaced statement. 5 The Authority must, without delay, give the Treasury a copy of any statement which it publishes under this section. 6 A statement issued under this section must be published by the Authority in the way appearing to the Authority to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public. 7 The Authority may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a copy of the statement. 8 In exercising, or deciding whether to exercise, a power under section 131G in the case of any particular contravention, the Authority must have regard to any statement of policy published under this section and in force at a time when the contravention occurred. Statement of policy: procedure 131K 1 Before issuing a statement under section 131J, the Authority must publish a draft of the proposed statement in the way appearing to the Authority to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public. 2 The draft must be accompanied by notice that representations about the proposal may be made to the Authority within a specified time. 3 Before issuing the proposed statement, the Authority must have regard to any representations made to it in accordance with subsection (2). 4 If the Authority issues the proposed statement it must publish an account, in general terms, of\u2014 a the representations made to it in accordance with subsection (2); and b its response to them. 5 If the statement differs from the draft published under subsection (1) in a way which is, in the opinion of the Authority, significant, the Authority must (in addition to complying with subsection (4)) publish details of the difference. 6 The Authority may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a copy of a draft published under subsection (1). 7 This section also applies to a proposal to alter or replace a statement."}, {"act": "Financial Services Act 2010", "year": 2010, "section": "9", "section_title": "Suspending permission to carry on regulated activities etc", "section_text": "9 In Part 14 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (disciplinary measures), after section 206 insert\u2014 Suspending permission to carry on regulated activities etc 206A 1 If the Authority considers that an authorised person has contravened a relevant requirement imposed on the person, it may\u2014 a suspend, for such period as it considers appropriate, any permission which the person has to carry on a regulated activity;

and b make the redress to the consumers. 8 A relevant firm is required to take the above steps in relation to any particular consumer even if, after the rules are made, a defence of limitation becomes available to the firm in respect of the loss or damage in question. 9 Before making rules under this section, the Authority must consult the scheme operator of the ombudsman scheme. 10 For the meaning of consumers, see section 404E. Rules under s.404: supplementary 404A 1 Rules under section 404 may make provision\u2014 a specifying the activities and requirements in relation to which relevant firms are to carry out investigations under consumer redress schemes; b setting out, in relation to any specified description of case, examples of things done, or omitted to be done, that are to be regarded as constituting a failure to comply with a requirement; c setting out, in relation to any specified description of case, matters to be taken into account, or steps to be taken, by relevant firms for the purpose of\u2014 i assessing evidence as to a failure to comply with a requirement; or ii determining whether such a failure has caused (or may cause) loss or damage to consumers; d as to the kinds of redress that are, or are not, to be made to consumers in specified descriptions of case and the way in which redress is to be determined in specified descriptions of case; e as to the things that relevant firms are, or are not, to do in establishing and operating consumer redress schemes; f securing that relevant firms are not required to investigate anything occurring after a specified date; g specifying the times by which anything required to be done under any consumer redress scheme is to be done; h requiring relevant firms to provide information to the Authority; i authorising one or more competent persons to do anything for the purposes of, or in connection with, the establishment or operation of any consumer redress scheme; j for the nomination or approval by the Authority of persons authorised under paragraph (i); k as to the circumstances in which, instead of a relevant firm, the Authority (or one or more competent persons acting on the Authority's behalf) may carry out the investigation and take the other relevant steps under any consumer redress scheme; l as to the powers to be available to those carrying out an investigation by virtue of paragraph (k); m as to the enforcement of any redress (for example, in the case of a money award, as a debt owed by a relevant firm). 2 The only examples that may be set out in the rules as a result of subsection (1)(b) are examples of things done, or omitted to be done, that have been, or would be, held by a court or tribunal to constitute a failure to comply with a requirement. 3 Matters may not be set out in the rules as a result of subsection (1)(c) if they have not been, or would not be, taken into account by a court or tribunal for the purpose mentioned there. 4 The Authority must exercise the power conferred as a result of subsection (1)(d) so as to secure that, in relation to any description of case, the only kinds of redress to be made are those which it considers to be just in relation to that description of case. 5 In acting under subsection (4), the Authority must have regard (among other things) to the nature and extent of the losses or damage in question. 6 The provision that may be made under subsection (1)(h) includes provision applying (with or without modifications)\u2014 a any provision of section 165; or b any provision of Part 11 relating to that section. 7 The reference in subsection (1)(k) to the other relevant steps under any consumer redress scheme is a reference to the Authority making the determinations mentioned in section 404(6) and (7)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(with the firm still required to make the redress). 8 If the rules include provision under subsection (1)(k), they must also include provision for\u2014 a giving warning and decision notices, and b conferring rights on relevant firms to refer matters to the Tribunal, in relation to any determination mentioned in section 404(6) and (7) made by the Authority. 9 Nothing in this section is to be taken as limiting the power conferred by section 404. Complaints to the ombudsman scheme 404B 1 If\u2014 a a consumer makes a complaint under the ombudsman scheme in respect of an act or omission of a relevant firm, and b at the time the complaint is made, the subject-matter of the complaint falls to be dealt with (or has been dealt with) under a consumer redress scheme, the way in which the complaint is to be determined by the ombudsman is to be as mentioned in subsection (4). 2 If a consumer\u2014 a is not satisfied with a determination made by a relevant firm under a consumer redress scheme, or b considers that a relevant firm has failed to make a determination in accordance with a consumer redress scheme, the consumer may, in respect of that determination or failure, make a complaint under the ombudsman scheme. 3 A complaint mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) is referred to in the following provisions of this section as a  \u201crelevant complaint\u201d. 4 A relevant complaint is to be determined by reference to what, in the opinion of the ombudsman, the determination under the consumer redress scheme should be or should have been (subject to subsection (5)). 5 If, in determining a relevant complaint, the ombudsman determines that the firm should make (or should have made) a payment of an amount to the consumer, the amount awarded by the ombudsman (a  \u201cmoney award\u201d) must not exceed the monetary limit (within the meaning of section 229). 6 But the ombudsman may recommend that the firm pay a larger amount. 7 A money award\u2014 a may specify the date by which the amount awarded is to be paid; b may provide for interest to be payable, at a rate specified in the award, on any amount which is not paid by that date; and c is enforceable by the consumer in accordance with Part 3 or 3A of Schedule 17 (as the case may be). 8 If, in determining a relevant complaint, the ombudsman determines that the firm should take (or should have taken) particular action in relation to the consumer, the ombudsman may direct the firm to take that action. 9 Compliance with a direction under subsection (8) is enforceable, on the application of the consumer, by an injunction or, in Scotland, by an order for specific performance under section 45 of the Court of Session Act 1988. 10 In consequence of the provision made by this section, sections 228(2) and 229 do not apply in relation to relevant complaints; but all other provision made by or under Part 16 applies in relation to those complaints. 11 The compulsory jurisdiction of the ombudsman scheme is to include the jurisdiction resulting from this section. 12 Nothing in subsection (1) is to be taken as requiring the ombudsman to determine a complaint in any case where (apart from that subsection) the complaint would not fall to be determined (whether as a result of rules made under Schedule 17 or otherwise). 13 Nothing in subsection (2) is to be taken as conferring an entitlement on a person who, for the purposes of the ombudsman scheme, is not an eligible complainant in relation to the subject-matter of the determination mentioned there. Enforcement 404C The following provisions\u2014 a Part 14 (disciplinary measures), and b so much of this Act as relates to any provision of that Part, (which apply only in relation to authorised persons) are also to apply in relation to relevant firms which are not (or are no longer) authorised persons. Applications to Tribunal to quash rules or provision of rules 404D 1 Any person may apply to the Tribunal for a review of any rules made under section 404. 2 The Tribunal may\u2014 a dismiss the application; or b make an order (a  \u201cquashing order\u201d) quashing any rules made under section 404 or any provision of those rules. 3 An application may be made only if permission to make it has first been obtained from the Tribunal. 4 The Tribunal may grant permission to make an application only if it considers that the applicant has a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates. 5 The general rule is that, in determining an application, the Tribunal is to apply the principles applicable on an application for judicial review. 6 If (or so far as) an application relates to an example set out in the rules as a result of section 404A(1)(b), the Tribunal may determine whether the example constitutes a failure to comply with the requirement in question. 7 If (or so far as) an application relates to a matter set out in the rules as a result of section 404A(1)(c), the Tribunal may determine whether the matter should be taken into account as mentioned in that provision. 8 In the case of an application within subsection (6) or (7), the Tribunal's jurisdiction under that subsection is in addition to its jurisdiction under subsection (5). 9 A quashing order may be enforced as if it were an order made, on an application for judicial review, by the High Court or, in Scotland, the Court of Session. 10 The Tribunal may award damages to the applicant if\u2014 a the application includes a claim for damages arising from any matter to which the application relates; and b the Tribunal is satisfied that an award would have been made by the High Court or, in Scotland, the Court of Session if the claim had been made in an action begun in that court by the applicant when making the application. 11 An award of damages under subsection (10) may be enforced as if it were an award made by the High Court or, in Scotland, the Court of Session. 12 In the case of any proceedings under this section, the judge presiding at the proceedings must be\u2014 a a judge of the High Court or the Court of Appeal or a judge of the Court of Session; or b such other person as may be agreed from time to time by\u2014 i the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord President or the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland (as the case may be); and ii the Senior President of Tribunals. 13 Section 133 does not apply in the case of an application under this section, but\u2014 a Tribunal Procedure Rules may make provision for the suspension of rules made under section 404 or of any provision of those rules, pending determination of the application; and b in the case of an application within subsection (6) or (7), the Tribunal may consider any evidence relating to the application's subject-matter, whether or not it was available at the time the rules were made. 14 If\u2014 a the Tribunal refuses to grant permission to make an application under this section, and b on an appeal by the applicant, the Court of Appeal grants the permission, the Court of Appeal may go on to decide the application under this section. Meaning of  \u201cconsumers\u201d 404E 1 For the purposes of sections 404 to 404B  \u201c consumers \u201d means persons who\u2014 a have used, or may have contemplated using, any of the services within subsection (2); or b have relevant rights or interests in relation to any of the services within that subsection. 2 The services within this subsection are services provided by\u2014 a authorised persons in carrying on regulated activities; b authorised persons in carrying on a consumer credit business in connection with the accepting of deposits; c authorised persons in communicating, or approving the communication by others of, invitations or inducements to engage in investment activity; d authorised persons who are investment firms, or credit institutions, in providing relevant ancillary services; e persons acting as appointed representatives; or f payment service providers in providing payment services. 3 A person (\u201cP\u201d) has a  \u201c relevant right or interest \u201d in relation to any services within subsection (2) if P has a right or interest\u2014 a which is derived from, or is otherwise attributable to, the use of the services by others; or b which may be adversely affected by the use of the services by persons acting on P's behalf or in a fiduciary capacity in relation to P. 4 If a person is providing a service within subsection (2) as a trustee, the persons who have been, or may have been, beneficiaries of the trust are to be treated as persons who have used, or may have contemplated using, the service. 5 A person who deals with another person (\u201cB\u201d) in the course of B providing a service within subsection (2) is to be treated as using the service. 6 In this section\u2014 \u201c accepting \u201d, in relation to deposits, includes agreeing to accept; \u201c consumer credit business \u201d has the same meaning as in the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (see section 189(1)); \u201c credit institution \u201d has the meaning given by section 138(1B); \u201c engage in investment activity \u201d has the meaning given by section 21; \u201c payment services \u201d has the same meaning as in the Payment Services Regulations 2009; \u201c payment service provider \u201d means a person who is a payment service provider for the purposes of those regulations as a result of falling within any of paragraphs (a) to (e) of the definition in regulation 2(1); \u201c relevant ancillary services \u201d has the meaning given by section 138(1C). Other definitions etc 404F 1 For the purposes of sections 404 to 404B\u2014 \u201c redress \u201d includes\u2014 interest; and a remedy or relief which could not be awarded in legal proceedings; \u201c specified \u201d means specified in rules made under section 404. 2 In determining for the purposes of those sections whether an authorised person has failed to comply with a requirement, anything which an appointed representative has done or omitted as respects business for which the authorised person has accepted responsibility is to be treated as having been done or omitted by the authorised person. 3 References in those sections to the failure by a relevant firm to comply with a requirement applicable to the carrying on by it of any activity include anything done, or omitted to be done, by it in carrying on the activity\u2014 a which is in breach of a duty or other obligation, prohibition or restriction; or b which otherwise gives rise to the availability of a remedy or relief in legal proceedings. 4 It does not matter whether\u2014 a the duty or other obligation, prohibition or restriction, or b the remedy or relief, arises as a result of any provision made by or under this or any other Act, a rule of law or otherwise. 5 References in sections 404 to 404B to a relevant firm include\u2014 a a person who was at any time a relevant firm but has subsequently ceased to be one; and b a person who has assumed a liability (including a contingent one) incurred by a relevant firm in respect of a failure by the firm to comply with a requirement applicable to the carrying on by it of any activity. 6 References in those sections to the carrying on of an activity by a relevant firm are, accordingly, to be read in that case with the appropriate modifications. 7 If the Authority varies a permission or authorisation of a person so as to impose requirements on the person to establish and operate a scheme which corresponds to, or is similar to, a consumer redress scheme, the provision that may be included in the permission or authorisation as varied includes\u2014 a provision imposing requirements on the person corresponding to those that could be included in rules made under section 404; and b provision corresponding to section 404B. 8 In subsection (7) the reference to the variation of a permission or authorisation by the Authority is a reference to\u2014 a the variation under section 44 or 45 of a Part IV permission; or b the variation under regulation 8 or 11 of the Payment Services Regulations 2009 of an authorisation under those regulations. Power to widen the scope of consumer redress schemes 404G 1 The Treasury may by order amend the definition of  \u201crelevant firms\u201d in section 404 or the definition of  \u201cconsumers\u201d in section 404E (or both). 2 An order under this section may make consequential amendments of any provision of sections 404 to 404F. 2 This section has effect in relation to failures occurring before the commencement of this section (as well as in relation to failures occurring at or after the commencement of this section)."}, {"act": "Financial Services Act 2010", "year": 2010, "section": "15", "section_title": "Restrictions on provision of credit card cheques", "section_text": "15 1 The Consumer Credit Act 1974 (\u201cthe CCA 1974\u201d) is amended as follows. 2 After section 51 insert\u2014 Restrictions on provision of credit card cheques 51A 1 A person who provides credit card cheques otherwise than in accordance with this section commits an offence. 2 Credit card cheques may be provided only to a person who has asked for them. 3 They may be provided only on a single occasion in respect of each request that is made. 4 The number of cheques provided in respect of a request must not exceed three (or, if less, the number requested). 5 Where a single request is made for the provision of credit card cheques in connection with more than one credit-token agreement, subsections (3) and (4) apply as if a separate request had been made in relation to each agreement. 6 Where more than one request for the provision of cheques is made in the same document or at the same time\u2014 a they may be provided in respect of only one of the requests, but b if the requests relate to more than one credit-token agreement, in relation to each agreement they may be provided only in respect of one of the requests made in relation to that agreement. 7 \u201c Credit card cheque \u201d means a cheque (whether or not drawn on a banker) which, whenever used, will result in the provision of credit under a credit-token agreement. 8 Accordingly,  \u201c credit card cheque \u201d does not include a cheque to be used only in connection with a current account.

Grounds for declining to act 224E 1 This section sets out the grounds referred to in section 224D(2) and (4). 2 The first ground is that the FSCS manager is not satisfied that it will be able to obtain any information required in order to comply with the section 224C notice. 3 The second ground is that the FSCS manager is not satisfied that it will be able to obtain any advice or other assistance from the manager of the relevant scheme that is required in order to comply with the section 224C notice. 4 The third ground is\u2014 a that the FSCS manager has not received an amount at least equal to the total expenses it expects to incur in connection with its relevant scheme functions; and b either\u2014 i that there are no arrangements for the provision of funds to the FSCS manager to enable it to exercise those functions and meet those expenses; or ii that the FSCS manager considers that any such arrangements are unsatisfactory. 5 The fourth ground is that the FSCS manager considers that complying with the section 224C notice would detrimentally affect the exercise of its functions under the FSCS. 6 The fifth ground is\u2014 a that there is no undertaking from the manager of the relevant scheme not to bring proceedings against the FSCS manager; or b that the FSCS manager considers that the terms of any such undertaking are unsatisfactory. 7 The sixth ground is\u2014 a that there are no arrangements for the reimbursement of any expenses incurred by the FSCS manager in connection with any proceedings brought against it in respect of its relevant scheme functions (including expenses incurred in meeting any award of damages made against it); or b that the FSCS manager considers that any such arrangements are unsatisfactory. 8 In subsection (6) references to an undertaking of the kind mentioned there are to an undertaking not to bring proceedings in respect of the FSCS manager's relevant scheme functions except proceedings in respect of an act or omission of the FSCS manager that is alleged to have been in bad faith. 9 In this section  \u201c proceedings \u201d includes proceedings outside the United Kingdom. Rules Rules about relevant schemes 224F 1 The Authority may by rules make provision in connection with the exercise by the FSCS manager of functions in respect of relevant schemes. 2 The provision that may be made by the rules includes any provision corresponding to provision that could be contained in the FSCS; but this is subject to subsections (3) and (4). 3 The rules may confer on the FSCS manager a power to impose levies on authorised persons (or any class of authorised persons) for the purpose of meeting its management expenses incurred in connection with its functions in respect of relevant schemes. 4 But if the rules confer such a power they must provide that the power may be exercised in relation to expenses incurred in connection with a relevant scheme only if the FSCS manager has tried its best to obtain reimbursement of the expenses from the manager of the relevant scheme. 5 The rules may apply any provision of the FSCS, with or without modifications. 6 An amount payable to the FSCS manager as a result of any provision of the rules made by virtue of subsection (3) may be recovered as a debt due to the FSCS manager. 7 References to the FSCS manager's  \u201cmanagement expenses\u201d are to its expenses incurred otherwise than in paying compensation."}, {"act": "Financial Services Act 2010", "year": 2010, "section": "18", "section_title": "Information relating to financial stability", "section_text": "18 1 The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 is amended as follows. 2 After section 165 insert\u2014 Authority's power to require information: financial stability 165A 1 The Authority may, by notice in writing given to a person to whom this section applies, require the person\u2014 a to provide specified information or information of a specified description; or b to produce specified documents or documents of a specified description. 2 This section applies to\u2014 a a person who has a legal or beneficial interest in any of the assets of a relevant investment fund; b a person who is responsible for the management of a relevant investment fund; c a person (a  \u201cservice provider\u201d) who provides any service to an authorised person; d a person prescribed by an order made by the Treasury or any person of a description prescribed by such an order (and see also section 165C); e a person who is connected with a person to whom this section applies as a result of any of the above paragraphs. 3 This section applies only to information and documents that the Authority considers are, or might be, relevant to the stability of one or more aspects of the UK financial system. 4 A notice may be given to a service provider, or to a person who is connected with a service provider, only if the Authority considers that\u2014 a the service or the way in which it (or any part of it) is provided, or b any failure to provide the service (or any part of it), poses, or would be likely to pose, a serious threat to the stability of the UK financial system. 5 Information or documents required under this section must be provided or produced\u2014 a before the end of such reasonable period as may be specified; and b at such place as may be specified. 6 The Authority may require any information provided under this section to be provided in such form as it may reasonably require. 7 The Authority may require\u2014 a any information provided, whether in a document or otherwise, to be verified in such manner as it may reasonably require; or b any document produced to be authenticated in such manner as it may reasonably require. 8 In this section\u2014 \u201c management \u201d includes any of the activities listed in Annex  II  to the  UCITS  directive; \u201c relevant investment fund \u201d means an investment fund whose assets consist of or include financial instruments which\u2014 are traded in the United Kingdom; or were issued by a body incorporated in the United Kingdom; \u201c service \u201d includes facility; \u201c specified \u201d means specified in the notice. 9 For the purposes of the definition of  \u201crelevant investment fund\u201d\u2014 a arrangements may constitute an investment fund even if there is only one person participating in the arrangements; and b the reference to financial instruments has the meaning given by Article 4.1(17) of the markets in financial instruments directive. 10 For the purposes of this section a person is connected with another person (\u201cA\u201d) if the person is or has at any relevant time been\u2014 a a member of A's group; b a controller of A; c any other member of a partnership of which A is a member; or d in relation to A, a person mentioned in Part 1 of Schedule 15 (reading references in that Part to the authorised person as references to A).
