or b the company is a new entrant (see section 357A(11)). 2 To determine the relevant IP profits\u2014  Step 1  Take any amounts which are brought into account as credits in calculating the profits of the trade for the accounting period, other than any amounts of finance income (see section 357BG), and divide them into two  \u201cstreams\u201d, amounts of relevant IP income (see sections 357BH to

The stream consisting of relevant IP income is  \u201cthe relevant IP income stream\u201d; the other stream is the  \u201cstandard income stream\u201d.  Step 2  Divide the relevant IP income stream into  \u201crelevant IP income sub-streams\u201d so that each sub-stream is\u2014 a sub-stream consisting of income properly attributable to a particular qualifying IP right (an  \u201cindividual IP right sub-stream\u201d), a sub-stream consisting of income properly attributable to a particular kind of IP item (a  \u201cproduct sub-stream\u201d), or a sub-stream consisting of income properly attributable to a particular kind of IP process (a  \u201cprocess sub-stream\u201d).

Step 3  Take any amounts which are brought into account as debits in calculating the profits of the trade for the accounting period, other than any excluded debits (see section 357BI), and allocate them on a just and reasonable basis between the standard income stream and each of the relevant IP income sub-streams.  Step 4  Deduct from each relevant IP income sub-stream\u2014 the amounts allocated to the sub-stream at Step 3, and the routine return figure for the sub-stream (see section 357BJ). But see section 357BIA (which provides that certain amounts allocated to a relevant IP income sub-stream at Step 3 are not to be deducted from the sub-stream at this Step).  Step 5  Deduct from each relevant IP income sub-stream which is greater than nil following Step 4 the marketing assets return figure for the sub-stream (see section 357BK).  Step 6  Multiply the amount of each relevant IP income sub-stream (following the deductions required at Steps 4 and 5) by the R&D fraction for the sub-stream (see section 357BL).  Step 7  Add together the amounts of the relevant IP income sub-streams (following Step 6).  Step 8  If the company has made an election under section 357BM (which provides in certain circumstances for profits arising before the grant of a right to be treated as relevant IP profits), add to the amount given by Step 7 any amount determined in accordance with subsection (3) of that section. 3 If the amount given by subsection (2) is greater than nil, that amount is the relevant IP profits of the trade for the accounting period. 4 If the amount given by subsection (2) is less than nil, that amount is the relevant IP losses of the trade for the accounting period (see Chapter 5). 5 In this section\u2014 \u201c IP item \u201d means\u2014 an item in respect of which a qualifying IP right held by the company has been granted, or an item which incorporates one or more items within paragraph (a); \u201c IP process \u201d means\u2014 a process in respect of which a qualifying IP right held by the company has been granted, or a process which incorporates one or more processes within paragraph (a). 6 For the purposes of this section two or more IP items, or two or more IP processes, may be treated as being of a particular kind if they are intended to be, or are capable of being, used for the same or substantially the same purposes. 7 Income may be allocated at Step 2 of subsection (2) to a product sub-stream or process sub-stream only if\u2014 a it would not be reasonably practicable to apportion the income between individual IP right sub-streams, or b it would be reasonably practicable to do that but doing so would result in it not being reasonably practicable to apply any of the remaining steps in subsection (2). 8 Any reference in this section to a qualifying IP right held by the company includes a reference to a qualifying IP right in respect of which the company holds an exclusive licence."}, {"act": "Corporation Tax Act 2010", "year": 2010, "section": "357BG", "section_title": "Finance income", "section_text": "357BG 1 For the purposes of this Part  \u201c finance income \u201d, in relation to a trade of a company, means\u2014 a any credits which are treated as receipts of the trade by virtue of\u2014 i section 297 of CTA 2009 (credits in respect of loan relationships), or ii section 573 of CTA 2009 (credits in respect of derivative contracts), b any amount which in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice falls to be recognised as arising from a financial asset, and c any return, in relation to an amount, which\u2014 i is produced for the company by an arrangement to which it is a party, and ii is economically equivalent to interest. 2 In subsection (1)\u2014 \u201c economically equivalent to interest \u201d is to be construed in accordance with section 486B(2) and (3) of CTA 2009, and \u201c financial asset \u201d means a financial asset as defined for the purposes of generally accepted accounting practice. 3 For the purposes of subsection (1)(c), the amount of a return is the amount which by virtue of the return would, in calculating the company's chargeable profits, be treated under section 486B of CTA 2009 (disguised interest to be regarded as profit from loan relationship) as profit arising to the company from a loan relationship.
