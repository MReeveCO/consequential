Step 1  Determine\u2014 whether any of the relevant income is brought into account in calculating C's chargeable profits for the purposes of the CFC charge or a foreign CFC charge, and if so, the amount of the relevant income that is so brought into account for the purposes of each relevant charge. If none of the relevant income is so brought into account, then none of it is  \u201cordinary income\u201d of a chargeable company and no further steps are to be taken. See subsections (10) to (12) for further provision about how this step is to be taken. For the purposes of this section\u2014 \u201crelevant chargeable profits\u201d are chargeable profits in relation to the calculation of which, for the purposes of the CFC charge or a foreign CFC charge, any of the relevant income is brought into account; \u201c relevant charge \u201d means a charge in relation to which any of the relevant income is brought into account in calculating chargeable profits.  Step 2  In relation to each relevant charge, determine the proportion of C's relevant chargeable profits, for the purposes of that charge, that is apportioned to each chargeable company. For the purposes of this section, each chargeable company to which 25% or more of C's relevant chargeable profits for the purposes of a relevant charge are apportioned is a  \u201crelevant chargeable company\u201d. If there are no relevant chargeable companies in relation to any relevant charges, then none of the relevant income is  \u201cordinary income\u201d of a chargeable company and no further steps are to be taken.  Step 3  In relation to each relevant chargeable company, determine what is the appropriate proportion of the relevant income brought into account in calculating relevant chargeable profits, for the purposes of the relevant charge concerned. That proportion of that income is  \u201cordinary income\u201d of that company for the taxable period for which that charge is charged on it by reference to those profits. For the purposes of this step, the  \u201c appropriate proportion \u201d, in relation to a relevant chargeable company, is the same as the proportion of the relevant chargeable profits that is apportioned to it for the purposes of the relevant charge. 4 An amount of relevant income that is ordinary income of a relevant chargeable company in accordance with subsection (3) is not ordinary income of C (so far as it otherwise would be). 5 Relevant chargeable profits apportioned to a relevant chargeable company for the purposes of a relevant charge are  \u201ctaxable profits\u201d of that company for the taxable period for which the charge is charged on it by reference to those profits. 6 The amount of the relevant income that is ordinary income of that relevant chargeable company under subsection (3), by virtue of being brought into account in calculating those relevant chargeable profits, is  \u201cincluded in\u201d those taxable profits. 7 References to tax charged on taxable profits include a relevant charge charged by reference to relevant chargeable profits that are taxable profits under subsection (5). 8 For the purposes of subsection (2)(b), an amount of ordinary income is  \u201cunder taxed\u201d if the highest rate at which tax is charged, for C's taxable period, on the taxable profits in which the amount is included, taking into account on a just and reasonable basis any credit for underlying tax, is less than C's full marginal rate for that period. 9 In subsection (8)\u2014 a C's  \u201c full marginal rate \u201d means the highest rate at which the tax that is chargeable on those taxable profits could be charged on taxable profits, of C for the taxable period, which include ordinary income that arises from, or in connection with, a financial instrument, and b \u201c credit for underlying tax \u201d means a credit or relief given to reflect tax charged on profits that are wholly or partly used to fund (directly or indirectly) the payment or quasi-payment mentioned in subsection (2)(b). 10 For the purposes of step 1 in subsection (3), section 259BC(3) applies for the purposes of determining the extent to which an amount of relevant income is brought into account in calculating chargeable profits as it applies for the purposes of determining the extent to which an amount of income is brought into account for the purposes of calculating taxable profits. 11 Subsection (12) applies for the purposes of step 1 in subsection (3), if\u2014 a the amount of income arising to C mentioned in subsection (2)\u2014 i is not all relevant income, and ii is only partly brought into account in calculating chargeable profits for the purposes of the CFC charge or a foreign CFC charge, and b accordingly, it falls to be determined whether, and to what extent, the relevant income is brought into account in calculating those profits for the purposes of the charge concerned. 12 The relevant income is to be taken to be brought into account (if at all) only to the extent that the total amount of income mentioned in subsection (2) that is brought into account exceeds the amount of income mentioned in that subsection that is not relevant income. 12A For the purposes of subsection (2)\u2014 a a qualifying CFC amount arising to C is treated as an amount of relevant income, b a qualifying CFC amount arising to C, for a permitted taxable period, is \u201cunder taxed\u201d if the highest rate at which tax is charged on the amount, taking into account on a just and reasonable basis the effect of any credit for underlying tax, is less than C\u2019s full marginal rate for that period, c in determining C\u2019s \u201cfull marginal rate\u201d, the reference to the taxable profits mentioned in subsection (9) includes any qualifying CFC amount, and d in determining a \u201ccredit for underlying tax\u201d, the reference to profits includes any qualifying  CFC  amount. 12B For the purposes of subsection (12A) a \u201cqualifying CFC amount\u201d means an amount arising to C which is brought into account in calculating chargeable profits for the purposes of a foreign CFC charge. 12C But an amount is not regarded for this purpose as brought into account so far as\u2014 a the amount is excluded, reduced or offset for the purposes of the foreign CFC charge by any exemption, exclusion, relief or credit that\u2014 i applies specifically to all or part of the amount (as opposed to amounts brought into account for those purposes generally), or ii arises as a result of, or otherwise in connection with, a payment or quasi-payment that gives rise to the amount, or b the sum charged for the purposes of the foreign CFC charge is, or falls to be, refunded (and section 259BC(6) and (7) apply for the

deduction/non-inclusion mismatch so far as the relevant deduction is\u2014 a a debit in respect of amortisation that is brought into account under section 729 or 731 of CTA 2009 (writing down the capitalised cost of an intangible fixed asset), or b an amount that is deductible in respect of amortisation under a provision of the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom that is equivalent to either of those sections. 2 The extent of the hybrid payee deduction/non-inclusion mismatch is equal to the excess that arises as mentioned in subsection (1)(b). 2A No excess is to be taken to arise by reason of a hybrid payee being a hybrid entity for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) so far as it is attributable to a qualifying institutional investor based in a territory under the law of which\u2014 a the income or profits of the hybrid entity are not treated as income or profits of the investor, or b the hybrid entity is regarded as a distinct and separate person to the investor. 2B Excess is attributable to such a qualifying institutional investor to the extent that ordinary income (arising by reason of the payment or quasi-payment) would fall to be brought into account by the investor if\u2014 a where subsection (2A)(a) applies, under the law of the territory the income or profits of the hybrid entity were treated as income or profits of the investor, and b where subsection (2A)(b) applies, under the law of the territory the hybrid entity were not regarded as a distinct and separate person to the investor. 2C To determine if a  \u201cqualifying institutional investor\u201d is  \u201cbased\u201d in a particular territory for the purposes of subsections (2A) and (2B) see section 259NDA. 3 A relevant amount of the excess is to be taken (so far as would not otherwise be the case) to arise as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) where\u2014 a a payee is a hybrid entity, b there is no territory\u2014 i where that payee is resident for the purposes of a tax charged   at a higher rate than nil  under the law of that territory, or ii under the law of which ordinary income arises to that payee, by reason of the payment or quasi-payment, for the purposes of a tax that is charged on that payee by virtue of that payee having a permanent establishment in that territory, and c no income arising to that payee, by reason of the payment or quasi-payment, is brought into account in calculating chargeable profits for the purposes of the CFC charge or a foreign CFC charge. 4 For the purposes of subsection (3), the  \u201crelevant amount\u201d of the excess is the lesser of\u2014 a the amount of the excess, and b an amount equal to the amount of ordinary income that it is reasonable to suppose would, by reason of the payment or quasi-payment, arise to the payee for corporation tax purposes, if\u2014 i the payee were a company, and ii the payment or quasi-payment were made in connection with a trade carried on by the payee in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom. 4A In applying subsection (4)(b) in a case where the payee is a partnership  or a relevant transparent entity , it is to be assumed that no amount of ordinary income arises to the payee, by reason of the payment or quasi-payment, if\u2014 a a partner in the partnership   , or a member of the entity,  is entitled to the amount, and b having regard only to\u2014 i the law of the territory where the partnership   or entity  is established, and ii the law of the territory where the partner   or member  is resident for tax purposes or, if the partner   or member  is not resident anywhere for tax purposes, where the partner   or member  is established, the payee would not be regarded as a hybrid entity. 4AA Subsection (4AB) applies in relation to a payment or quasi-payment if\u2014 a one or more of the payees is a partnership or a relevant transparent entity, b there is a territory under the law of which an amount of ordinary income would arise, or would potentially arise, to a hybrid entity as a result of the circumstances giving rise to the relevant deduction if the entity were a person resident in that territory for the purposes of a tax charged under the law of that territory, and c that hybrid entity is not (ignoring subsection (4AB)(b)) a payee. 4AB Where this subsection applies\u2014 a if any such hybrid entity is not either a partnership or a relevant transparent entity, subsection (4A) does not apply, or b otherwise, every such hybrid entity is to be treated as a payee for the purposes of determining, for the purposes of subsection (1)(b), if an excess arises by reason of one or more payees being hybrid entities. 4B In  subsections (4A) to (4AB) and (4C)  \u201cpartnership\u201d has the meaning given by section 259NE(4). 4C An entity is a \u201crelevant transparent entity\u201d if\u2014 a the entity is not a partnership, b the entity is legally constituted in a territory outside the United Kingdom, c all of the entity\u2019s income or profits for the purposes of a tax charged under the law of that territory are treated (or would be if there were any) for the purposes of that tax as the income or profits of its members, and d any such tax that is, or that would be, charged on such a member that is resident for tax purposes in that territory is not charged at a nil rate. 4D For the purposes of subsection (4C), a person is a \u201cmember\u201d of an entity if the person is entitled to a proportion of the profits of the entity as a result of\u2014 a where the entity has share capital, holding shares forming part of that capital, or b where the entity does not have share capital, an entitlement similar to that which would be enjoyed if the entity had share capital and the person held shares forming part of that capital. 5 In subsection (3)(c)  \u201cchargeable profits\u201d\u2014 a in relation to the CFC charge, has the same meaning as in Part 9A (see section 371VA), and b in relation to a foreign CFC charge, means the concept (by whatever name known) corresponding to chargeable profits within the meaning of that Part. 6 A taxable period of a payee is  \u201c permitted \u201d in relation to an amount of ordinary income that arises as a result of the payment or quasi-payment if\u2014 a the period begins before the end of 12 months after the end of the payment period, or b where the period begins after that\u2014 i a claim has been made for the period to be a permitted period in relation to the amount of ordinary income, and ii it is just and

For this purpose, assume that the non-UK SPFs determined at step 4 are all carried out by the CFC itself (if that is not otherwise the case).  Step 6  Exclude from the relevant assets and risks any asset or risk, or any assets or risks taken together, to which section 371DC applies.  Step 7  Re-determine the CFC's assumed total profits on the basis that the CFC\u2014 does not hold, or has not held, the assets included in the relevant assets and risks, and does not bear, or has not borne, the risks included in the relevant assets and risks, so far as they would be attributed to the permanent establishment mentioned at step 5.\u201cThe provisional Chapter 4 profits\u201d are the CFC's assumed total profits so far as they are left out of the re-determined profits.

activities in relation to public infrastructure assets, and b a requirement for the company to make an election (which may be revoked, subject to a 5-year rule in relation to the revocation and the

same company as the property rental business company.   2A In applying subsection (2) and giving effect to the remainder of this section, the company is treated, at all times in the accounting period, as carrying on a residual business within the charge to corporation tax (and, accordingly, amounts falling to be brought into account in the accounting period as a result of this section are within the charge to corporation tax).   3 In applying the provisions of this Part\u2014 a the property rental business company and the residual business company are at all times to be regarded as separate members of the same worldwide group (despite the provisions of section 541(3) of CTA 2010), but b in the case of the application of section 433 (qualifying infrastructure company), the property rental business company and the residual business company are to be regarded as being one company (and any election (or its revocation) is, therefore, regarded as made by each company). 4 This Part has effect as if\u2014 a section 534(1) and (2) of CTA 2010, and b section 535(1) and (5) of CTA 2010, do not apply in relation to the property rental business company for the accounting period  (and,

the profits of the property rental business for the purposes of section 530 of CTA 2010 (condition as to distribution of profits), but b must be limited to such amount as secures that neither

If the residual business company does not have net tax-interest expense referable to that period, it is treated for the purposes of steps 1 to 4 in the rest of this subsection as if it had instead a nil amount of tax-interest expense referable to that period.  Step 1  Determine the maximum amount that could be the allocated disallowance for the property rental business company for the accounting period if subsection (5) were ignored and the maximum amount that could be the allocated disallowance for the residual business company for the accounting period (ignoring step 5). The sum of those maximum amounts is referred to in this subsection as  \u201cthe total REIT expenses\u201d.
