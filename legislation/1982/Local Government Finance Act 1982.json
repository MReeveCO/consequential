and for the purposes of this subsection the product of a substituted rate or precept shall be estimated by reference to the same gross rateable value as the product of the original rate or precept. 3 Section 12(6) of the  General Rate Act 1967 (which requires a precept to be issued or notified before the beginning of a financial year) shall not apply to a precept issued by virtue of subsection (1)(b) above. 4 Where a precept is substituted by virtue of this section any authority which has made a rate by reference to the original precept\u2014 a shall under subsection (1)(a) above make a substituted rate by reference to the substituted precept;

and b as to any excess, be repaid if the ratepayer by whom that sum was paid or, as the case may be, the authority to which the precept was issued so requires. 6 Where repayment of any amount is not required under subsection (5)(b) above that amount shall, as the rating or precepting authority may determine, either be repaid or\u2014 a in the case of an amount paid in respect of a rate, be credited against any subsequent liability of the ratepayer for rates in respect of the hereditament in question; b in the case of an amount paid in respect of a precept, be credited against any subsequent liability of the authority to which the precept was issued in respect of precepts issued to it by the precepting authority. 7 Where a person as tenant or licensee of any premises\u2014 a is liable to make payments (whether as part of his rent or otherwise) which vary or may vary according to the rates chargeable in respect of those premises; or b is entitled to make deductions from his rent in respect of those rates, he shall, where a rate affecting those premises is substituted by virtue of this section, be entitled to recover or, as the case may be, liable to make good so much of any payment or deduction as he would not have been liable or entitled to make if the original rate had corresponded to the substituted rate;
