Restrictions on power to give transfer notice. 101G 1 In the case of a salary related occupational pension scheme, the power to give a transfer notice may only be exercised if\u2014 a the member has been provided with a statement under section 101H, and b not more than 3 months have passed since the date by reference to which the amount shown in the statement is determined. 2 The power to give a transfer notice may not be exercised in the case of an occupational pension scheme if\u2014 a there is less than a year to go until the member reaches normal benefit age, or b the pension to which the member is entitled by virtue of his pension credit rights, or benefit in lieu of that pension, or any part of it has become payable. 3 Where an eligible member of a qualifying scheme\u2014 a is entitled to make an application under section 95 to the trustees or managers of the scheme, or b would be entitled to do so, but for the fact that he has not received a statement under section 93A in respect of which the guarantee date is sufficiently recent, he may not, if the scheme so provides, exercise the power to give them a transfer notice unless he also makes an application to them under section 95. 4 The power to give a transfer notice may not be exercised if a previous transfer notice given by the member to the trustees or managers of the scheme is outstanding.  Salary related schemes: statements of entitlement. 101H 1 The trustees or managers of a qualifying scheme which is a salary related occupational pension scheme shall, on the application of an eligible member, provide him with a written statement of the amount of the cash equivalent of his pension credit benefit under the scheme. 2 For the purposes of subsection (1), the amount of the cash equivalent shall be determined by reference to a date falling within\u2014 a the prescribed period beginning with the date of the application, and b the prescribed period ending with the date on which the statement under that subsection is provided to the applicant. 3 Regulations may make provision in relation to applications under subsection (1) and may, in particular, restrict the making of successive applications. 4 If trustees or managers to whom subsection (1) applies fail to perform an obligation under that subsection, section 10 of the  Pensions Act 1995 (power of the Regulatory Authority to impose civil penalties) shall apply to any trustee or manager who has failed to take all such steps as are reasonable to secure that the obligation was performed.

Withdrawal of transfer notice. 101K 1 Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a person who has given a transfer notice may withdraw it by giving the trustees or managers to whom it was given notice in writing that he no longer requires them to comply with it. 2 A transfer notice may not be withdrawn if the trustees or managers have already entered into an agreement with a third party to use the whole or part of the amount they are required to use in accordance with the notice. 3 If the giving of a transfer notice depended on the making of an application under section 95, the notice may only be withdrawn if the application is also withdrawn.  Variation of the amount required to be used. 101L 1 Regulations may make provision for the amount required to be used under section 101F(1) to be increased or reduced in prescribed circumstances. 2 Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the circumstances which may be prescribed include\u2014 a failure by the trustees or managers of a qualifying scheme to comply with a notice under section 101F(1) within 6 months of the date by reference to which the amount of the cash equivalent falls to be determined, and b the state of funding of a qualifying scheme. 3 Regulations under subsection (1) may have the effect of extinguishing an obligation under section 101F(1).
