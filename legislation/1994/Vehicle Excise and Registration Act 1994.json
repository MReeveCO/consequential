to its design weight. 3 Subject to subsection (4), the design weight of a vehicle is, for the purposes of this section\u2014 a in the case of a tractive unit, the weight which is required, by the design and any subsequent adaptations of that vehicle, not to be exceeded by an articulated vehicle which\u2014 i consists of the vehicle and any semi-trailer capable of being drawn by it, and ii is in normal use and travelling on a road laden; and b in the case of any other vehicle, the weight which the vehicle itself is designed or adapted not to exceed when in normal use and travelling on a road laden. 4 Where, at any time, a vehicle\u2014 a does not have a confirmed maximum weight, b has previously had such a weight, and c has not acquired a different design weight by reason of any adaptation made since the most recent occasion on which it had a confirmed maximum weight, the vehicle\u2019s design weight at that time shall be equal to its confirmed maximum weight on that occasion. 5 An adaptation reducing the design weight of a vehicle shall be disregarded for the purposes of this section unless it is a permanent adaptation. 6 For the purposes of this Act where\u2014 a a vehicle which does not have a confirmed maximum weight is used on a public road in the United Kingdom, and b at the time when it is so used\u2014 i the weight of the vehicle, or ii in the case of a tractive unit used as part of an articulated vehicle consisting of the vehicle and a semi-trailer, the weight of the articulated vehicle, exceeds what, apart from this subsection, would be the vehicle\u2019s design weight, it shall be conclusively presumed, as against the person using the vehicle, that the vehicle has been temporarily adapted so as to have a design weight while being so used equal to the actual weight of the vehicle or articulated vehicle at that time. 7 For the purposes of this Act limitations on the space available on a vehicle for carrying a load shall be disregarded in determining the weight which the vehicle is designed or adapted not to exceed when in normal use and travelling on a road laden. 8 A vehicle which does not have a confirmed maximum weight shall not at any time be taken to have a revenue weight which is greater than the maximum laden weight at which that vehicle or, as the case may be, an articulated vehicle consisting of that vehicle and a semi-trailer may lawfully be used in Great Britain. 9 A vehicle has a confirmed maximum weight at any time if at that time\u2014 a it has a plated gross weight or a plated train weight;

semi-trailer   to lawfully   be used in Great Britain; and the confirmed maximum weight of a vehicle with such a weight shall be taken to be the weight referred to in paragraph (a). 10 Where any vehicle has a special maximum weight in Northern Ireland which is greater than the maximum laden weight at which that vehicle or, as the case may be, an articulated vehicle consisting of that vehicle
