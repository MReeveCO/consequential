ending within the surcharge period specified in (or extended by) that notice, and c the aggregate value of his defaults in respect of that prescribed accounting period is more than nil, that person

which would be the amount of that person\u2019s outstanding  VAT  for that period for the purposes of section 59(4); and b the amount of unpaid payments on account referred to in that paragraph is the amount (if any) equal to so much of any payments on account of  VAT  (being payments in respect of that period) as has not been received by the Commissioners by the last day on which that person is required (as mentioned in section 59(1)) to make a return for that period. 8 If a person who, apart from this subsection, would be liable to a surcharge under subsection (4) above satisfies the

subsection (11) below, where\u2014 a there is an appeal against a decision of   HMRC   with respect to, or to so much of any assessment as concerns, the amount of input tax that may be credited to any

amusement or entertainment, the tribunal shall not allow the appeal or, as the case may be, so much of it as relates to that determination unless it considers that the determination is one which it was unreasonable to make or which it would have been unreasonable to make if information brought to the attention of the tribunal that could not have been brought to the attention of  HMRC  had been available to be taken into account when the determination was made. 4ZA Where an appeal is brought\u2014 a against such a decision as is mentioned in section   83(1) (fza), or b to the extent that it is based on such a decision, against an assessment, the tribunal shall not allow the appeal unless it considers that   HMRC   could not reasonably have been satisfied that there were grounds for the

(3)\u2014 a the notice shall have effect pending the determination of the appeal, and b if the appeal is allowed, the notice shall be deemed never to have had effect. 4C Where an appeal is brought against the giving of a notice under section 43C(1), the tribunal shall not allow the appeal unless it considers that   HMRC   could not reasonably have been satisfied that there were grounds for giving the notice. 4D Where\u2014 a an appeal is brought against the giving of a notice under section 43C(3), and b the grounds of appeal relate wholly or partly to the date specified in the notice, the tribunal shall not allow the appeal in respect of the date unless it considers that   HMRC   could not reasonably have been satisfied that it was appropriate. 4E Where an appeal is brought against a requirement imposed under paragraph 4(2)(b) of Schedule 11 that a person give security, the tribunal shall allow the appeal unless   HMRC  satisfies   the tribunal that\u2014 a there has been an evasion of, or an attempt to evade,  VAT  in relation to goods or services supplied to or by that person, or b it is likely, or without the requirement for security it is likely, that  VAT  in relation to such goods or services will be evaded. 4F A reference in subsection (4E) above to evading  VAT  includes a reference to obtaining a  VAT  credit that is not due or a  VAT  credit in excess of what is due.  5 Where, on an appeal against a decision with respect to any of the matters mentioned in section   83(1) (p)  or (rb)  \u2014 a it is found that the amount specified in the assessment is less than it ought to have been, and b the tribunal gives a direction specifying the correct amount, the assessment shall have effect as an assessment of the amount specified in the direction, and that amount shall be deemed to have been notified to the appellant. 6 Without prejudice to section 70,   ... nothing in section   83(1) (q) shall be taken to confer on a tribunal any power to vary an amount assessed by way of  penalty, interest or surcharge   penalty or interest   except in so far as it is necessary to reduce it to the amount which is appropriate under sections  59   60   to 70;

tribunal shall not allow the appeal unless it considers that   HMRC   could not reasonably have been satisfied as to the matters in sub-paragraph (2)(a) to (d) of paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 or, as the case may be,  that there were grounds for making the direction. 7A Where there is an appeal against a decision to make such a direction as is mentioned in section   83(1) (wa), the cases in which the tribunal shall allow the appeal shall include (in addition to the case where the conditions for the making of the direction were not fulfilled) the case where the tribunal are satisfied, in relation to the relevant event by reference to which the direction was given, that\u2014 a the change in the treatment of the body corporate, or b the transaction in question, had as its main purpose or, as the case may be, as each of its main purposes a genuine commercial purpose unconnected with the fulfilment of the condition specified in paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 9A. 7ZA Where there is an appeal against such a refusal as is mentioned in section   83(1) (wb)\u2014 a the tribunal shall not allow the appeal unless it considers that   HMRC   could not reasonably have been satisfied that there were grounds for the refusal, and b the refusal shall have effect pending the determination of the appeal. 7B Where there is an appeal against a decision to make such a direction as is mentioned in section   83(1) (zza)\u2014 a the tribunal shall not allow the appeal unless it considers that   HMRC   could not reasonably have been satisfied that there were grounds for making the direction; b the
