of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances. 2B For the purposes of this Act, the quality of goods includes their state and condition and the

conformity with the contract, and b in the case of a contract for sale by sample, of comparing the bulk with the sample. 3 Where the buyer deals as consumer or (in Scotland) the contract of sale is a consumer contract, the buyer cannot lose his right to rely on subsection (2) above by agreement, waiver or otherwise. 4 The buyer is also deemed to have accepted the goods when after the lapse of a reasonable time he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them. 5 The questions that are material in determining for the purposes of subsection (4) above whether a reasonable time has elapsed include whether the buyer has had a reasonable opportunity of examining the goods for the purpose mentioned in subsection (2) above. 6 The buyer is not by virtue of this section deemed to have accepted the goods merely because\u2014 a he asks for, or agrees to, their repair by or under an arrangement with the seller, or b the goods are delivered to another under a
