Circumstances in which an application for an order under this Part can be made 27B 1 Paragraphs 27C and 27D apply where\u2014 a premises within the scope of this Part are occupied under a lease (the  \u201ctarget premises\u201d), b the lessee in occupation requests an operator to provide an electronic communications service to the target premises, c in order to fulfil that request, the operator requires a person (the  \u201crequired grantor\u201d) to agree\u2014 i to confer on the operator a code right in respect of connected land, or ii otherwise to be bound by such a code right exercisable by the operator, d the operator has, on or after the day on which section 1 of the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Act 2021 comes fully into force, given the required grantor a notice in accordance with paragraph 20(2) of this code seeking that agreement (the  \u201crequest notice\u201d), and e the required grantor has not responded to the operator. 2 Premises are within the scope of this Part if they\u2014 a form part of a multiple dwelling building (see paragraph 27I(1)), or b are other premises of a description specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State. 3 In this Part  \u201c connected land \u201d, in relation to the target premises, means land which\u2014 a is in common ownership with the target premises (see paragraph 27I(2)), and b is held or used for access to, or otherwise in connection with, the target premises. 4 For the purposes of this paragraph, the required grantor responds to the operator if the required grantor\u2014 a agrees or refuses, in writing, to confer or otherwise be bound by the code right specified in the request notice on the terms that the operator seeks, or b otherwise acknowledges the request notice in writing. Requirements to be met before applying for an order under this Part 27C 1 Before applying to the court for an order under this Part (a  \u201cPart 4A order\u201d)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(see paragraph 27E(2)) the operator must, in accordance with this paragraph, give the required grantor\u2014 a two warning notices, and b a final notice. 2 A  \u201cwarning notice\u201d is a notice in writing which\u2014 a includes a copy of the request notice, b states that it is the first or (as the case may be) second of three notices that, unless the required grantor responds to the operator, will allow the operator to apply for a Part 4A order, and c explains the effect of a Part 4A order. 3 The first warning notice may only be given after the end of the period of seven days beginning with the day on which the request notice was given. 4 The second warning notice may only be given after the end of the period of seven days beginning with the day on which the first one was given. 5 A  \u201cfinal notice\u201d is a notice in writing which\u2014 a includes a copy of the request notice, b states that unless the required grantor responds to the operator before the end of the period of 14 days beginning with the day on which the final notice is given, the operator intends to apply for a Part 4A order, and c explains the effect of a Part 4A order. 6 A final notice may only be given within the permitted period. 7 The  \u201c permitted period \u201d means the period which\u2014 a begins immediately after the end of whichever of the following ends last\u2014 i the period of seven days beginning with the day on which the second warning notice was given; ii the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the request notice was given, and b ends at the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the second warning notice was given. 8 The Secretary of State may by regulations specify other conditions that the operator must satisfy before giving the required grantor a final notice. 27D 1 The operator may apply to the court for a Part 4A order in relation to the code right specified in the request notice if\u2014 a the operator has satisfied the notice requirements set out in paragraph 27C, b the period of 14 days beginning with the day on which the final notice was given has ended, c the required grantor has not responded to the operator, and d the operator has satisfied any other specified conditions. 2 An application for a Part 4A order may not be made after the end of the specified period beginning with the day on which the final notice is given. 3 The operator must give the required grantor notice of an application for a Part 4A order. 4 For the purposes of this paragraph, the required grantor responds to the operator if the required grantor\u2014 a agrees or refuses, in writing, to confer or otherwise be bound by the code right specified in the request notice on the terms that the operator seeks, or b otherwise acknowledges, in writing, the request notice, a warning notice or the final notice. 5 In this paragraph  \u201c specified \u201d means specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State. When a Part 4A order can be made and its effect 27E 1 The court may make a Part 4A order if (and only if)\u2014 a it is satisfied that the requirements for applying for the order have been met, and b the required grantor has not objected to the making of the order. 2 A Part 4A order is an order which imposes on the operator and the required grantor an agreement between them\u2014 a by which the required grantor confers on the operator the code right identified in the request notice in respect of the connected land so identified, or b which provides for the code right identified in that notice, which is exercisable by the operator in respect of the connected land so identified, otherwise to bind the required grantor. 3 In this code, a  \u201c Part 4A code right \u201d means a code right which is conferred by or otherwise binds the required grantor pursuant to an agreement imposed by a Part 4A order. 4 The terms of an agreement imposed by a Part 4A order are to be those specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State. 5 Regulations under sub-paragraph (4) must, in particular, provide for an agreement to include terms\u2014 a relating to the provision by the operator to the required grantor of details of the works to be carried out in the exercise of the Part 4A code right (\u201c the works \u201d); b relating to the obtaining by the operator of any consent, permit, licence, permission, authorisation or approval which is necessary for the works to be carried out; c relating to the giving of notice by the operator to the required grantor or other specified persons before entering on the connected land in the exercise of the Part 4A code right or carrying out the works; d restricting the operator's right to enter on the connected land to specified times, except in cases of emergency; e as to the manner in which the works are to be carried out by the operator; f relating to the restoration by the operator of the connected land at the end of the works, to the reasonable satisfaction of the required grantor; g relating to the need for insurance cover or indemnification of the required grantor; h relating to the maintenance or upgrading by the operator of apparatus installed on, under or over the connected land in the exercise of the Part 4A code right (\u201cthe apparatus\u201d); i imposing requirements or restrictions on the required grantor for the purposes of\u2014 i preventing damage to the apparatus, ii facilitating access to the apparatus for the operator, or iii otherwise preventing or minimising disruption to the operation of the apparatus; j relating to assignment of the agreement; k aimed at ensuring that nothing done by the operator in the exercise of the Part 4A code right unnecessarily prevents or inhibits the provision of an electronic communications service by any other operator. 6 Before making regulations under sub-paragraph (4), the Secretary of State must consult\u2014 a operators, b persons appearing to the Secretary of State to represent owners of interests in land who are likely to be affected by the regulations, and c any other persons the Secretary of State thinks appropriate. 7 In sub-paragraph (5),  \u201cspecified\u201d mean specified, or of a description specified, in the regulations. Exercise of Part 4A code rights 27F 1 A Part 4A code right may be exercised by the operator in respect of the connected land for the provision of an electronic communications service to\u2014 a the target premises, and b other premises, but only if the provision of the service to the other premises in addition to the target premises imposes no additional burden on the required grantor. 2 For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(b), an additional burden includes anything that\u2014 a has an additional adverse effect on the required grantor's enjoyment of the connected land, or b causes additional loss, damage or expense to the required grantor. Expiry of Part 4A code rights 27G 1 A Part 4A code right ceases to be conferred on the operator by, or otherwise to bind, the required grantor\u2014 a if a replacement agreement comes into effect, in accordance with that agreement, b if the court decides to refuse an application by the operator for the imposition of a replacement agreement, in accordance with that decision, or c if the right has not ceased to have that effect as mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) before the end of the specified period beginning with the day on which the agreement imposed by the Part 4A order comes into effect, at the end of that period. 2 In sub-paragraph (1) a  \u201c replacement agreement \u201d, in relation to a Part 4A code right, means an agreement under Part 2 by which the required grantor confers a code right on the operator, or otherwise agrees to be bound by a code right which is exercisable by the operator, where that right is in respect of the same land as the Part 4A code right. 3 In sub-paragraph (1)(c)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201c specified period \u201d means the period, of no more than 18 months, specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State. 4 The required grantor has the right, subject to and in accordance with Part 6 of this code, to require the operator to remove any electronic communications apparatus placed on the connected land in the exercise of a Part 4A code right which has ceased to have effect, or otherwise to bind, the required grantor. Compensation 27H 1 This paragraph applies where the court has made a Part 4A order. 2 The court may, on the application of the required grantor, order the operator to pay compensation to the required grantor for any loss or damage that has been sustained or will be sustained by the required grantor as a result of the exercise by the operator of the Part 4A code right. 3 An application for an order under this paragraph may be made at any time after the Part 4A order is made (including at a time when the Part 4A code right has ceased to be conferred on the operator by, or otherwise to bind, the required grantor). 4 An order under this paragraph may\u2014 a specify the amount of compensation to be paid by the operator, or b give directions for the determination of any such amount. 5 Directions under sub-paragraph (4)(b) may provide\u2014 a for the amount of compensation to be agreed between the operator and the required grantor; b for any dispute about that amount to be determined by arbitration. 6 An order under this paragraph may provide for the operator\u2014 a to make a lump sum payment, b to make periodical payments, c to make a payment or payments on the occurrence of an event or events, or d to make a payment or payments in such other form or at such other time or times as the court may direct. 7 Paragraph 84 makes further provision about compensation in the case of a Part 4A order.
