make a statement to that effect (a \u201cstatement of non-compliance\u201d).     7   A statement of non-compliance does not affect the validity of the conduct in respect of which it is given.     8   Where the court makes a statement of non-compliance it may grant any remedy that could be granted by it on a judicial review other than damages, but only if Condition A or Condition B is met.     9   Condition A is that the court is satisfied that granting the remedy would not\u2014   a   be likely to cause substantial hardship to, or substantially prejudice the rights of, any person other than the authority, or     b   be detrimental to good administration.       10   Condition B is that Condition A is not met but the court is satisfied that\u2014   a   granting the remedy is necessary in order to prevent or mitigate serious damage to the natural environment or to human health, and     b   there is an exceptional public interest reason to grant it.       11   In deciding whether to grant a remedy the court must (subject to subsection  (8) ) apply the principles applicable on an application for judicial review; but this does not require the court to apply section 31(2A) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (High Court to refuse to grant relief where the outcome for the applicant not substantially different) on an environmental review in England and Wales.     12   If, on an
