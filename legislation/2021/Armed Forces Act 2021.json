Vehicle to be treated as used for purposes of certain offences   177D    1   This section applies where a person\u2014   a   commits an offence to which subsection (2) applies by driving, attempting to drive, or being in charge of a vehicle, or     b   as the driver of a vehicle, commits an offence under section 42 as respects which the corresponding offence under the law of England and Wales is an offence under section\u00a0170(4) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (duty to stop, report accident and give information or documents).       2   This subsection applies to an offence under section 42 as respects which the corresponding offence under the law of England and Wales is\u2014   a   an offence under the Road Traffic Act 1988 which is punishable with imprisonment,     b   an offence of manslaughter, or     c   an offence under section 35 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (wanton and furious driving).       3   The vehicle is to be regarded for the purposes of  section 177C(3)  (and section 94A(3)(b)(ii)) as used for the purpose of committing the offence (including where it is committed by aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring).        Exercise of power to make deprivation order   177E    1   In considering whether to make a deprivation order in respect of any property, the decision maker must have regard to\u2014   a   the value of the property, and     b   the likely financial and other effects on the offender of making the order (taken together with any other order that the decision maker contemplates making).       2   Where a deprivation order is available for an offence, the decision maker may make such an order whether or not it deals with the offender in any other way for the offence.        Application of proceeds of property subject to deprivation order   177F    1   This section applies where the Court Martial or the Service Civilian Court makes a deprivation order in relation to any property and\u2014   a   the offence was one which resulted in a person suffering personal injury, loss or damage, or     b   any such offence is taken into consideration by the court in determining sentence.       2   The court may also make an order that any proceeds which\u2014   a   arise out of the disposal of the property, and     b   do not exceed a sum specified by the court,    are to be paid to the person.     3   A court may make an order under this section only if satisfied that, but for the inadequacy of the offender\u2019s means, it would have made a service compensation order under which the offender would have been required to pay compensation of an amount not less than the amount specified under subsection (2)(b).     4   \u00a0An order under this section has no effect\u2014   a   before the end of the 6 month period mentioned in section  94A (3) (a) , or     b   if a successful claim by a person claiming to be the owner of the property has been made by virtue of section 94(2)(a).              5   After section 94 (property in possession of service police or CO\ufeff) insert\u2014    Property subject to deprivation order: modification of section 94   94A    1   This section applies to property to which a deprivation order relates which is in the possession of\u2014   a   a commanding officer, or     b   a member of a service police force,    by virtue of section 177C(6) (including any such property that was already in the possession of the commanding officer or a member of a service police force when the order was made).     2   Regulations under section 94(1) must ensure that a judicial authority or a commanding officer may make an order by virtue of section 94(2)(a) or (b) (respectively) on an application which\u2014   a   relates to property to which this section applies, and     b   is made by a person claiming to be the owner of the property,    only if the conditions in subsection  (3)  are met.     3   Those conditions are that\u2014   a   the application is made before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the day on which the deprivation order is made, and     b   the claimant satisfies the judicial authority or the commanding officer (as the case may be)\u2014   i   that the claimant did not consent to the offender\u2019s possession of the property, or\u00a0     ii   if the deprivation order was made by virtue of subsection (3) of section 177C (property used for the purpose of offence etc), that the claimant did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the property was likely to be used for a purpose mentioned in that subsection.         4   Regulations under section 94(1) may enable a judicial authority or a commanding officer to make any order for disposal of property to which this section applies that the judicial authority or commanding officer (as the case may be) thinks appropriate (but this is subject to subsection  (6) ).     5   In subsection (4) the reference to disposal includes disposal by way of transferring the property into the ownership of the Secretary of State; but regulations made by virtue of subsection (4) may not provide for the Secretary of State to become the owner of property which is the subject of an order under section 177F (application of proceeds of property subject to deprivation order).     6   Subsection (4) applies only in relation to cases where no application by virtue of section 94(2)(a) or (b) made during the 6 month period mentioned in subsection  (3) (a)  by a person claiming to be the owner of the property was successful.     7   In this section \u201cjudicial authority\u201d means the Court Martial, the Service Civilian Court or a judge advocate.           6   In  Schedule 3  (civilians etc: modifications of Court Martial sentencing powers)\u2014   a   in paragraph 1(1), in the table, after row 7 insert\u2014     8 a deprivation order (defined by section 177B) only if section 177C permits     ;     b   in paragraph 3(1), in the table, after row 10 insert\u2014     11 a deprivation order (defined by section 177B) only if section 177C permits     .

Extension of disqualification where custodial sentence or service detention also imposed   177J    1   This section applies where a court\u2014   a   imposes a custodial sentence or a sentence of service detention on an offender for an offence, and     b   makes a driving disqualification order in respect of the offender for the same offence.       2   But this section does not apply where the

Effect of custodial sentence or service detention in other cases   177K    1   This section applies where a court makes a driving disqualification order in respect of an offender for an offence, and\u2014   a   it imposes a custodial sentence or a sentence of service detention (other than a suspended sentence) on the offender for another offence, or     b   a custodial sentence or a sentence of service detention previously imposed on the offender has not expired.       2   In determining the disqualification period, the court must, so far as it is appropriate to do so, have regard to the diminished effect of disqualification as a distinct punishment if the person who is disqualified is also detained in pursuance of a custodial sentence or a sentence of service detention.     3   But the court may not take into account for this purpose any custodial sentence or sentence of service detention that it imposes on the offender for the offence.        Requirement to produce licences where driving disqualification order made   177L   A court which makes a driving disqualification order in respect of an offender must require the offender to produce any (and, if more than one, all) of the following held by the offender\u2014   a   a licence to drive a motor vehicle granted under Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988;     b   a Northern Ireland licence (within the meaning of Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988);     c   a Community licence (within the meaning of Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988).
