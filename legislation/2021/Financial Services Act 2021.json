consider appropriate to secure that, after the repeal or revocation of the relevant Gibraltar provision, the same provision is made in connection with Gibraltar as is made in connection with most or all other countries or territories outside the United Kingdom. 6 The Treasury may not make regulations under subsection (1)(b), (c) or (d) unless they are satisfied that doing so is compatible with each of the following objectives\u2014 a to protect and enhance the soundness, stability and resilience of the UK financial system; b to protect and enhance public confidence in the UK financial system; c to prevent the use of the UK financial system for a purpose connected with financial crime; d to ensure that, in the United Kingdom, financial markets and significant markets for financial

to make such modifications as the Treasury consider appropriate having regard to changes in the law of any part of the United Kingdom since the relevant regulations listed in subsection (3) or (4) were made, and b power to restate relevant Gibraltar provision in a clearer or more accessible way. 9 Where provision saving or modifying a provision is repealed or revoked under subsection (1)(a), the power under subsection (1)(b) includes power to make provision with the same effect as the provision that was the subject of the saving or modification, read with the saving or modification. 10 The power under subsection (1)(d) includes power to make provision applying provisions of section 32A of, or Schedule 2A or 2B to, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, with or without modifications. 11 Regulations under this section may\u2014 a make different provision for different purposes; b confer functions on a person, including functions involving the exercise of a discretion; c amend, revoke, repeal or otherwise modify an enactment; d make consequential, incidental, supplementary, transitional, transitory or saving provision. 12 Regulations under this section are subject to the affirmative procedure. 13 For the purposes of this section, provision that is saved or modified by regulations listed in subsection (3) or (4) is Gibraltar provision if, when read with the saving or modification, it relates to a matter described in subsection (2)(a). 14 In this section\u2014 \u201c consumers \u201d has the meaning given in section 1G of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000; \u201c financial crime \u201d has the meaning given in section 1H of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000; \u201c public funds \u201d means the Consolidated Fund and any
