Directions under section 31U: supplementary 31V 1 A direction under section 31U has binding effect from the time it is made until the witness in relation to whom it applies is discharged. 2 But the court may revoke a direction under section 31U before the witness is discharged, if it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice to do so, either\u2014 a on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or b of its own motion. 3 The court may revoke a direction under section 31U on an application made by a party to the proceedings only if there has been a material change of circumstances since\u2014 a the direction was given, or b if a previous application has been made by a party to the proceedings, the application (or the last application) was determined. 4 The court must state its reasons for\u2014 a giving a direction under section 31U; b refusing an application for a direction under section 31U; c revoking a direction under section 31U; d refusing an application for the revocation of a direction under section 31U.

Alternatives to cross-examination in person 85K 1 This section applies where a party to civil proceedings is prevented from cross-examining a witness in person by virtue of any of sections 85F to 85I. 2 The court must consider whether (ignoring this section) there is a satisfactory alternative means\u2014 a for the witness to be cross-examined in the proceedings, or b of obtaining evidence that the witness might have given under cross-examination in the proceedings. 3 If the court decides that there is not, the court must\u2014 a invite the party to the proceedings to arrange for a qualified legal representative to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, and b require the party to the proceedings to notify the court, by the end of a period specified by the court, of whether a qualified legal representative is to act for the party for that purpose. 4 Subsection (5) applies if, by the end of the period specified under subsection (3)(b), either\u2014 a the party has notified the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, or b no notification has been received by the court and it appears to the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness. 5 The court must consider whether it is necessary in the interests of justice for the witness to be cross-examined by a qualified legal representative appointed by the court to represent the interests of the party. 6 If the court decides that it is, the court must appoint a qualified legal representative (chosen by the court) to cross-examine the witness in the interests of the party. 7 A qualified legal representative appointed by the court under subsection (6) is not responsible to the party. 8 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a a reference to cross-examination includes a reference to continuing to conduct cross-examination; b \u201c qualified legal representative \u201d means a person who, for the purposes of the Legal Services Act 2007, is an authorised person in relation to an activity which constitutes the exercise of a right of audience (within the meaning of that Act) in civil proceedings.
