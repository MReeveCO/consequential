activity) that satisfies the test in subsection (3), either by specifying such a role or activity generally or by specifying a particular role or activity. 5 For the purposes of section 93A(3A) and (3B), an accident does not involve an aircraft or a ship simply because it takes place on an aircraft or ship. 6 In section 93A(3C), references to the carrying out of a safety-critical function are

in section 93I); or b the carrying out by a person who is a civilian subject to service discipline, in the course of the person's employment, of a role or activity which, if it were carried out by a person subject to service law in the course of his or her duty, would be a safety-critical duty. 7 References in section 93A and this section to a person carrying out a function include a failure by
