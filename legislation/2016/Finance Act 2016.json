Liability of directors for relevant PAYE debts 97ZI 1 This regulation applies in relation to an amount of relevant PAYE debt of a company if the company does not deduct that amount by the time by which the company is required to do so. 2 HMRC may serve a notice (a  \u201cpersonal liability notice\u201d) on any person who was, on the relevant date, a director of the company\u2014 a specifying the amount of relevant PAYE debt in relation to which this regulation applies (\u201c the specified amount \u201d), and b requiring the director to pay to HMRC\u2014 i the specified amount, and ii specified interest on that amount. 3 The interest specified in the personal liability notice\u2014 a is to be at the rate applicable under section 178 of the Finance Act 1989 for the purposes of section 86 of TMA, and b is to run from the date the notice is served. 4 A director who is served with a personal liability notice is liable to pay to HMRC the specified amount and the interest specified in the notice within 30 days beginning with the day the notice is served. 5 If HMRC serve personal liability notices on more than one director of the company in respect of the same amount of relevant PAYE debt, the directors are jointly and severally liable to pay to HMRC the specified amount and the interest specified in the notices. Appeals in relation to personal liability notices 97ZJ 1 A person who is served with a personal liability notice in relation to an amount of relevant PAYE debt of a company may appeal against the notice. 2 A notice of appeal must\u2014 a be given to HMRC within 30 days beginning with the day the personal liability notice is served, and b specify the grounds of the appeal. 3 The grounds of appeal are \u2014 a that all or part of the specified amount does not represent an amount of relevant PAYE debt, of the company, to which regulation 97ZI applies, or b that the person was not a director of the company on the relevant date. 4 But a person may not appeal on the ground mentioned in paragraph (3)(a) if it has already been determined, on an appeal by the company, that\u2014 a the specified amount is a relevant PAYE debt of the company, and b the company did not deduct, account for, or (as the case may be) pay the debt by the time by which the company was required to do so. 5 Subject to paragraph (6), on an appeal that is notified to the tribunal, the tribunal is to uphold or quash the personal liability notice. 6 In a case in which the ground of appeal mentioned in paragraph (3)(a) is raised, the tribunal may also reduce or increase the specified amount so that it does represent an amount of relevant PAYE debt, of the company, to which regulation 97ZI applies. Withdrawal of personal liability notices 97ZK 1 A personal liability notice is withdrawn if the tribunal quashes it. 2 An officer of Revenue and Customs may withdraw a personal liability notice if the officer considers it appropriate to do so. 3 If a personal liability notice is withdrawn, HMRC must give notice of that fact to the person upon whom the notice was served. Recovery of sums due under personal liability notice: application of Part 6 of TMA 97ZL 1 For the purposes of this Chapter, Part 6 of TMA (collection and recovery) applies as if\u2014 a the personal liability notice were an assessment, and b the specified amount, and any interest on that amount under regulation 97ZI(2)(b)(ii), were income tax charged on the director upon whom the notice is served, and that Part of that Act applies with the modification in paragraph (2) and any other necessary modifications. 2 Summary proceedings for the recovery of the specified amount, and any interest on that amount under regulation 97ZI(2)(b)(ii), may be brought in England and Wales or Northern Ireland at any time before the end of the period of 12 months beginning with the day after the day on which the personal liability notice is served. Repayment of surplus amounts 97ZM 1 This regulation applies if\u2014 a one or more personal liability notices are served in respect of an amount of relevant PAYE debt of a company, and b the amounts paid to HMRC (whether by directors upon whom notices are served or the company) exceed the aggregate of the specified amount and any interest on it under regulation 97ZI(2)(b)(ii). 2 HMRC is to repay the difference on a just and equitable basis and without unreasonable delay. 3 HMRC is to pay interest on any sum repaid. 4 The interest\u2014 a is to be at the rate applicable under section 178 of the Finance Act 1989 for the purposes of section 824 of  ICTA , and b is to run from the date the amounts paid to HMRC come to exceed the aggregate mentioned in subsection (1)(b). 5 The amendment made by subsection (4) is to be treated as having been made by the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in exercise of the power conferred by section 688B of ITEPA 2003 (inserted by subsection (3)). 6 The amendment made by subsection (1) has effect in relation to the tax year 2016-17 and subsequent tax years. 7 The amendment made by subsection (4) has effect in relation to

Reduction for accumulated or discretionary trust income: entitlement 274B 1 If for a tax year the trustees of a settlement have\u2014 a a relievable amount in respect of a property business, or b two or more relievable amounts each in respect of a different property business, the trustees of the settlement are entitled to relief under this section for that year in respect of that relievable amount or (as the case may be) each of those relievable amounts. 2 The trustees of a settlement have a relievable amount for a tax year in respect of a property business if for that year the trustees of the settlement have a current-year amount, or brought-forward amount, in respect of that business (or have both). 3 In the case of trustees of a settlement, their relievable amount for a tax year in respect of a property business is the total of\u2014 a their current-year amount (if any) for that year in respect of that business, and b their brought-forward amount (if any) for that year in respect of that business. 4 The trustees of a settlement have a current-year amount for a tax year in respect of a property business if\u2014 a an amount (\u201cA\u201d) would be deductible in calculating the profits for income tax purposes of that business for that year but for section 272A, b the trustees of the settlement are liable for income tax on N% of those profits, where N is a number\u2014 i greater than 0, and ii less than or equal to 100, and c in relation to the trustees of the settlement, that N% of those profits is accumulated or discretionary income, in which event the current-year amount of the trustees of the settlement for that tax year in respect of that business is equal to N% of A. 5 As to whether the trustees of a settlement have a brought-forward amount for a tax year in respect of a property business, see section 274C(3). 6 In this section and section 274C  \u201c accumulated or discretionary income \u201d has the meaning given by section 480 of ITA 2007. Reduction for accumulated or discretionary trust income: calculation 274C 1 This section applies if for a tax year the trustees of a settlement are entitled to relief under section 274B in respect of a relievable amount or in respect of each of two or more relievable amounts, and in the following subsections of this section  \u201c relievable amount \u201d means that relievable amount or (as the case may be) any of those relievable amounts. 2 The amount of the relief in respect of a relievable amount is given by\u2014 L \u00d7 BR where\u2014 BR is the basic rate of income tax for the year, and L is the lower of\u2014 the relievable amount, and the profits for income tax purposes of the property business concerned for the year after any deduction under section 118 of ITA 2007 (\u201cthe adjusted profits\u201d) or, if less, the share of the adjusted profits\u2014 on which the trustees of the settlement are liable for income tax, and which, in relation to the trustees of the settlement, is accumulated or discretionary income. 3 Where L in the case of a relievable amount is less than the relievable amount, the difference between them is the brought-forward amount of the trustees of the settlement for the following tax year in respect of the property business concerned. 2 In consequence of the amendment made by subsection (1), in F(No.2)A 2015 omit section 24(5)."},

Claims for additional relief: carry-forward relief 412C 1 A person (\u201cL\u201d) may make a claim for relief under this section if\u2014 a L is entitled to relief under section 412A in respect of any outstanding amount of the principal of a loan (\u201cthe relevant loan\u201d), but b in the tax year in relation to which L is entitled to that relief (\u201c the relevant year \u201d)\u2014 i L has no income of the kind mentioned in section 412A(4) or section 412B(3) from which to deduct the outstanding amount, or ii L has insufficient income of that kind to enable the outstanding amount to be deducted in full under those sections. 2 The claim is for the outstanding amount or (in a case within subsection (1)(b)(ii)) the part of the outstanding amount not capable of being deducted under sections 412A and 412B to be deducted under this section in calculating L's net income for the four tax years following the relevant year. 3 The deduction under this section is to be made only from income arising from the payment to L of interest on\u2014 a the relevant loan, and b any other loan within subsection (4) or (5). 4 A loan is within this subsection if\u2014 a it is a peer-to-peer loan made by L, and b it was made through an operator (whether or not that operator is the operator through whom the relevant loan was made). 5 A loan is within this subsection if\u2014 a the loan was made by someone other than L, b the right to receive interest on the loan has been assigned to L, c that right was assigned through an operator (whether or not that operator is the operator through whom the relevant loan was made), and d either\u2014 i L is a person within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of section 412I(4), or ii the recipient of the loan is a person within one of those paragraphs and the loan is a personal or small loan. 6 This section needs to be read with section 412D (how relief works). How carry-forward relief works 412D 1 This subsection explains how deductions are to be made under section 412C. The amount to be deducted at any step is limited in accordance with section 25(4) and (5). Step 1  Deduct the outstanding amount or (in a case within section 412C(1)(b)(ii)) the part of the outstanding amount not capable of being deducted under sections 412A and 412B from the lending income for the first tax year following the relevant year. Step 2  Deduct from the lending income for the second tax year following the relevant year any part of the outstanding amount not previously deducted. Step 3  Apply Step 2 in relation to the lending income for the third and fourth tax years following the relevant year, stopping if all of the outstanding amount is deducted. 2 In this section\u2014 \u201c lending income \u201d means income of a kind mentioned in section 412C(3); \u201c relevant year \u201d has the meaning given by section 412C(1)(b).

Average holding period Average holding period 809FZC 1 The average holding period of an investment scheme, in relation to a sum of carried interest, is the average length of time for which relevant investments have been held for the purposes of the scheme. 2 In this section,  \u201c relevant investments \u201d means investments\u2014 a which are made for the purposes of the scheme, and b by reference to which the carried interest is calculated. 3 The average holding period is calculated by reference to the time the carried interest arises. 4 It is calculated as follows. Step 1  For each relevant investment, multiply the value invested at the time the investment was made by the length of time for which the investment has been held. Step 2  Add together the amounts produced under  step 1  in respect of all relevant investments. Step 3  Divide the amount produced under  step 2  by the total value invested in all relevant investments. 5 Disregard intermediate holdings or intermediate holding structures (including intermediate investment schemes) by or through which investments are made or held\u2014 a when identifying, for the purpose of determining the average holding period of an investment scheme, what relevant investments are held for the purposes of an investment scheme, and b for any other purpose relating to the determination of the average holding period. This is subject to the following provisions of this Chapter. 6 In this section, references to the length of time for which a relevant investment has been held are\u2014 a in the case of an investment which has been disposed of before the carried interest arises, references to the time for which it was held before being disposed of, and b in any other case, references to the time for which it has been held up to the time the carried interest arises. 7 For the purposes of this Chapter, carried interest which is deferred carried interest in relation to a person within the meaning of section 103KG of TCGA 1992 is to be treated as arising to that person at the time it would have arisen had it not been deferred as specified in section 103KG(3)(a) or (b) of that Act. 8 Sections 809FZD to 809FZP apply for the purposes of determining the average holding period of an investment scheme. Average holding period: disposals Disposals 809FZD 1 An investment or part of an investment is disposed of where\u2014 a there is a disposal of the investment or the part of the investment for the purposes of the investment scheme, b there is a disposal for the purposes of the investment scheme of an intermediate holding or intermediate holding structure (including an intermediate investment scheme) by or through which the investment is held, or c in any other case, there is a deemed disposal under subsection (2). 2 There is a deemed disposal of an investment or part of an investment under this subsection where\u2014 a under any arrangements\u2014 i the scheme in substance closes its position on the investment or the part of the investment, or ii the scheme ceases to be exposed to risks and rewards in the respect of the investment or the part of the investment, and b it is reasonable to suppose that the arrangements were designed to secure that result. 3 In the case of a disposal of part of a holding of securities in a company which are of the same class, suppose for the purposes of determining which investments have been disposed of that the disposal affects the securities in the order in which they were acquired (that is, on a first in first out basis). 4 The references in subsection (1)(a) and (b) to a disposal are to something which is a disposal for the purposes of TCGA 1992; but for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) disregard section 116 of TCGA 1992 (which disapplies sections 127 to 130 of that Act in relation to qualifying corporate bonds). Part disposals 809FZE 1 Where there is a disposal of part of an investment, the part disposed of and the part not disposed of are to be treated as two separate investments which were made at the same time. 2 The value of each of those two separate investments is the appropriate proportion of the value first invested in the whole investment. 3 The appropriate proportion is the proportion of the value of the part in question to the value of the whole investment at the time of the disposal. 4 The disposal of part of an asset includes the disposal of an interest in or right over the asset (and  \u201c part disposed of \u201d is to be construed accordingly). Unwanted short-term investments 809FZF 1 The making and disposal of an investment for the purposes of an investment scheme are to be disregarded if\u2014 a the investment is an unwanted short-term investment, and b the unwanted short-term investment is excludable. 2 An investment is an unwanted short-term investment where\u2014 a the investment is made as part of a transaction under which one or more other investments are made for the purposes of the scheme, b the value of the investment does not exceed that of the other investments taken together, c it is reasonable to suppose that the investment had to be made in order for the other investments to be made, d at the time the investment is made, managers of the scheme have a firm, settled and evidenced intention to dispose of the investment for the purposes of the scheme within the relevant period, e the investment is disposed of for the purposes of the scheme within the relevant period, and f any profit resulting from the disposal has no bearing on whether a sum of carried interest arises or on the amount of any sum of carried interest which does arise. 3 An unwanted short-term investment is excludable if it constitutes\u2014 a an investment in land, b an investment in securities in an unlisted company, c the making of a direct loan where the other investments specified in subsection (2)(b) are shares or other securities in an unlisted company, or d the making of a direct loan which is a qualifying loan within the meaning given by section 809FZR(2). 4 In subsection (2)(e)  \u201c relevant period \u201d means\u2014 a for an investment within subsection (3)(a), 12 months; b for an investment within subsection (3)(b) or (c), 6 months; c for an investment within subsection (3)(d), 120 days. 5 But if at any time it becomes reasonable to suppose that, when the scheme ceases to invest, 25% or more of the capital of the investment scheme will have been invested in unwanted short-term investments which are excludable, subsection (1) does not apply to any investment made subsequently for the purposes of the scheme. Average holding period: derivatives and hedging Derivatives 809FZG 1 A derivative contract entered into for the purposes of an investment scheme is an investment, subject to the following provisions of this section. 2 The value invested in the derivative contract is\u2014 a where the contract is an option, the cost of acquiring the option (whether from the grantor or another person), b where the contract is a future, the price specified in the contract for the underlying subject matter, or c where the contract is a contract for differences, the notional principal of the contract. 3 But where entering into a derivative contract constitutes a deemed disposal of an investment or part of an investment by virtue of section 809FZD(2)(a)(ii)\u2014 a the derivative contract is not an investment, and b the subsequent disposal of the derivative contract without a corresponding disposal of the investment or part investment is to be regarded as the making of a new investment to the extent that the scheme becomes materially exposed to risks and rewards in respect of the investment or part investment. 4 For the purposes of this Chapter, references to disposal, in the case of a derivative contract, include any of the following events (to the extent that the event is not otherwise a disposal under section 809FZD(1) or (2))\u2014 a the expiry of the contract, b the termination of the contract (whether or not in accordance with its terms), c the disposal, substantial variation, loss or cancellation of the investment scheme's rights under the contract, and d in the case of a derivative contract which is an option, the exercise of the option, but do not include the renewal of the contract with the same counterparty on substantially the same terms. 5 The substantial variation of an investment scheme's rights under a derivative contract constitutes (in addition to the disposal of the contract as originally entered into (see subsection (4)(c)) a new investment consisting of the contract as varied. Hedging: exchange gains and losses 809FZH 1 This section applies where\u2014 a an investment scheme has a hedging relationship between a relevant instrument and a relevant investment, and b the hedging relationship relates to exchange gains or losses. 2 In this section\u2014 \u201c relevant instrument \u201d means a derivative contract or a liability representing a loan relationship, and \u201c relevant investment \u201d means\u2014 where the relevant instrument is a derivative contract, an investment made for the purposes of the scheme or a liability representing a loan relationship; where the relevant instrument is a liability representing a loan relationship, an investment made for the purposes of the scheme. 3 An investment scheme has a hedging relationship between a relevant instrument and a relevant investment if or to the extent that\u2014 a the instrument and the investment are designated by the scheme as a hedge, or b in any other case, the instrument is intended to act as a hedge of exposure to\u2014 i changes in fair value of the investment or an identified portion of the investment, or ii variability in cash flows, where the exposure is attributable to exchange gains or losses and could affect profit or loss of the investment scheme. 4 Entering into the hedging relationship is not a deemed disposal of the relevant investment under section 809FZD(2). 5 The relevant instrument is not an investment for the purposes of the investment scheme to the extent that the conditions in subsection (3)(a) and (b) are met. 6 But the termination of the hedging relationship is the making of an investment constituting the relevant instrument if or to the extent that that instrument continues to subsist. Hedging: interest rates 809FZI 1 This section applies where an investment scheme has a hedging relationship between\u2014 a an interest rate contract, and b a qualifying investment held for the purposes of the fund. 2 An investment scheme has a hedging relationship between an interest rate contract and a qualifying investment if or to the extent that\u2014 a the interest rate contract and the investment are designated by the scheme as a hedge, or b in any other case, the interest rate contract is intended to act as a hedge of exposure to\u2014 i changes in fair value of the investment or an identified portion of the investment, or ii variability in cash flows, where the exposure is attributable to interest rates and could affect profit or loss of the investment scheme. 3 Entering into the hedging relationship is not a deemed disposal of the relevant investment under section 809FZD(2). 4 The interest rate contract is not an investment for the purposes of the investment scheme to the extent that the conditions in subsection (2)(a) and (b) are met. 5 But the termination of the hedging relationship is the making of an investment constituting the interest rate contract if or to the extent that the interest rate contract continues to subsist. 6 In this section  \u201c qualifying investment \u201d means\u2014 a money placed at interest, b securities (excluding shares issued by companies), c alternative finance arrangements, and d a liability representing a loan relationship. Average holding period: aggregation of acquisitions and disposals Significant interests 809FZJ 1 Where an investment scheme has a controlling interest in a trading company or the holding company of a trading group\u2014 a any investment made for the purposes of the scheme in that company after the time when the controlling interest was acquired is to be regarded as having been made at that time, and b any disposal for the purposes of the scheme of an investment in the company after the time the controlling interest was acquired is to be regarded as not being made until a relevant disposal is made. 2 In subsection (1)(b)  \u201c relevant disposal \u201d, in relation to a company, means a disposal which (apart from subsection (1)) has the effect that the investment scheme ceases to have a 40% interest in the company. 3 For the purposes of this section, in determining whether an investment scheme has a controlling interest or a 40% interest in a company, any share capital of the company which is held for the purposes of an associated investment scheme is to be regarded as held for the purposes of the investment scheme. Venture capital funds 809FZK 1 Where a venture capital fund has a relevant interest in a trading company or the holding company of a trading group\u2014 a any venture capital investment made for the purposes of the scheme in the company after the time the relevant interest was acquired (and before a relevant disposal) is to be regarded as having been made at the time the relevant interest was acquired, and b any disposal for the purposes of the scheme of a venture capital investment in the company after that time is to be regarded as not being made until\u2014 i a relevant disposal is made, or ii the scheme director condition ceases to be met. 2 For the purposes of subsection (1) a venture capital fund has a relevant interest in a company if \u2014 a by virtue of its venture capital investments the fund has at least a 5% interest in the company, or b venture capital investments held for the purposes of the scheme in the company have a value of more than \u00a31 million. 3 For the purposes of subsection (1)  \u201c relevant disposal \u201d means a disposal which (apart from subsection (1)) has the effect that the venture capital fund has disposed of more than 80% of the greatest amount invested at any one time in the company for the purposes of the fund. 4 In this Chapter,  \u201c venture capital fund \u201d means an investment scheme in relation to which the condition in subsection (5) is met. 5 The condition is that when the scheme starts to invest it is reasonable to suppose that over the investing life of the scheme\u2014 a at least two-thirds of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be invested in venture capital investments, and b at least two-thirds of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be invested in investments which are held for 40 months or more. 6 In determining whether subsection (5)(b) is met in relation to an investment scheme, apply the rule in subsection (1) to the scheme. 7 In this section,  \u201c venture capital investment \u201d, in relation to an investment scheme, means an investment in a trading company or the holding company of a trading group where\u2014 a at the time the investment is made the company is unlisted and is likely to remain so, b at least 75%of the total value of the investment is invested in\u2014 i newly issued shares or ii newly issued securities convertible into shares, c the investment is used in a trade carried on by the trading company or the trading group\u2014 i to support its growth, or ii for the development of new products or services, and is not used directly or indirectly to acquire shares in the company which are not newly issued, d if the investment is the first investment made in the company for the purposes of the scheme, the trading company or group has not carried on that trade for more than 7 years, and e the scheme director condition is met. 8 In this Chapter, the scheme director condition, in relation to an investment scheme and a company, is that\u2014 a the scheme (or the scheme and one or more investment schemes acting together) are entitled to appoint a director (\u201cthe scheme director\u201d) of\u2014 i the company, or ii a company which controls the company, and b the scheme director is entitled to exercise rights within subsection (9). 9 Those rights are rights which\u2014 a are rights conferred under contractual arrangements\u2014 i to which some or all of the investors in the company are parties, and ii which it would be reasonable to suppose would not otherwise be capable of being exercised by the scheme director, b relate to the conduct of the business and affairs of the company, and c are at least equivalent to the rights which it is reasonable to suppose a prudent investor would have obtained on making an investment in the company at arm's length of the same size and nature as that held in the company for the purposes of the investment scheme. 10 In determining whether the condition in subsection (2)(a) or (b) is met in relation to a venture capital fund, any share capital of a company which is held for the purposes of an associated investment scheme is to be regarded as held for the purposes of the venture capital fund. Significant equity stake funds 809FZL 1 Where a significant equity stake fund has a significant equity stake investment in a trading company or the holding company of a trading group\u2014 a any investment made for the purposes of the fund in that company made after the time the significant equity stake investment was acquired is to be regarded as having been made at that time, and b any disposal for the purposes of the fund of an investment in the company after that time is to be regarded as not being made until\u2014 i a relevant disposal is made, or ii the scheme director condition ceases to be met. 2 In subsection (1)(b)  \u201c relevant disposal \u201d means a disposal which (apart from subsection (1)) has the effect that the significant equity stake fund ceases to have a 15% interest in the company. 3 In this Chapter,  \u201c significant equity stake fund \u201d means an investment scheme\u2014 a which is not a venture capital fund, and b in relation to which the condition in subsection (4) is met. 4 The condition is that when the scheme starts to invest it is reasonable to suppose that over the investing life of the scheme\u2014 a more than 50% of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be invested in investments which are significant equity stake investments, and b more than 50% of that value will be invested in investments which are held for 40 months or more. 5 In determining whether subsection (4)(b) is met in relation to an investment scheme, apply the rule in subsection (1) to the scheme. 6 In this section,  \u201c significant equity stake investment \u201d, in relation to an investment scheme, means an investment in a trading company or the holding company of a trading group where\u2014 a at the time the investment is made, the company is unlisted and likely to remain so, b by virtue of the investment (on its own or with other investments) the scheme has a 20% interest in the company, and c the scheme director condition is met. 7 For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a significant equity stake fund has an interest of a particular percentage in a company, any share capital of the company which is held for the purposes of an associated investment scheme is to be regarded as held for the purposes of the significant equity stake fund. Controlling equity stake funds 809FZM 1 Where a controlling equity stake fund has a 25% interest in a trading company or the holding company of a trading group\u2014 a any investment made for the purposes of the controlling equity stake fund in the company after the time the 25% interest was acquired is to be regarded as having been made at that time, and b any disposal for the purposes of the controlling equity stake fund of an investment in the company after that time is to be regarded as not being made until a relevant disposal is made. 2 In subsection (1)(b),  \u201c relevant disposal \u201d, in relation to a company, means a disposal which (apart from subsection (1)) has the effect that the controlling equity stake fund ceases to have a 25% interest in the company. 3 In this Chapter,  \u201c controlling equity stake fund \u201d means an investment scheme\u2014 a which is not a venture capital fund or significant equity stake fund, and b in relation to which the condition in subsection (4) is met. 4 The condition is that when the scheme starts to invest it is reasonable to suppose that, over the investing life of the scheme\u2014 a more than 50% of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be invested in investments which are controlling interests in trading companies or holding companies of trading groups, and b more than 50% of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be invested in investments which are held for 40 months or more. 5 In determining whether subsection (4)(b) is met in relation to an investment scheme, apply the rule in subsection (1) to the scheme. 6 For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a controlling equity stake fund has a controlling interest or an interest of a particular percentage in a company, any share capital of the company which is held for the purposes of an associated investment scheme is to be regarded as held for the purposes of the controlling equity stake fund. Real estate funds 809FZN 1 Where a real estate fund has a major interest in any land\u2014 a any investment made for the purposes of the fund in that land after the time the major interest was acquired is to be regarded as having been made at that time, and b any disposal for the purposes of the fund of an investment in the land after that time is to be regarded as not being made until a relevant disposal is made. 2 In subsection (1)(b)  \u201c relevant disposal \u201d means a disposal which (apart from subsection (1)) has the effect that the real estate fund has disposed of more than 50% of the greatest amount invested at any one time in the land for the purposes of the real estate fund. 3 Where a real estate fund has a major interest in any land (\u201cthe original land\u201d) and subsequently acquires a major interest in any adjacent land\u2014 a the acquisition is an investment in the original land for the purposes of subsection (1)(a), and b after the acquisition, the adjacent land is to be regarded as part of the original land for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2). 4 In this Chapter,  \u201c real estate fund \u201d means an investment scheme\u2014 a which is not a venture capital fund, significant equity stake fund or controlling equity stake fund, and b in relation to which the condition in subsection (5) is met. 5 The condition is that when the scheme starts to invest it is reasonable to suppose that over the investing life of the scheme\u2014 a more than 50% of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be invested in land, and b more than 50% of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be invested in investments which are held for 40 months or more. 6 In determining whether subsection (5)(b) is met in relation to an investment scheme, apply the rule in subsection (1) to the scheme. Funds of funds 809FZO 1 Section 809FZC(5) (disregard of intermediate holdings and holding structures) does not apply to an investment made for the purposes of a fund of funds in a collective investment scheme (and, accordingly, such an investment is regarded as an investment in the collective investment scheme itself). 2 Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a fund of funds in relation to a collective investment scheme if it is reasonable to suppose that the main purpose or one of the main purposes of the making of any investment in any collective investment scheme for the purposes of the fund of funds is to reduce the proportion of carried interest arising to any person which is income-based carried interest. 3 Where by virtue of subsection (1) a fund of funds has a significant investment in a collective investment scheme (\u201c the underlying scheme \u201d)\u2014 a any qualifying investment made for the purposes of the fund in the underlying scheme after the time the significant investment was acquired is to be regarded as having been made at that time, and b any disposal for the purposes of the fund of a qualifying investment in the underlying scheme after that time is to be regarded as not being made until a relevant disposal is made. 4 In subsection (3)(b)  \u201c relevant disposal \u201d, in relation to an underlying scheme, means a disposal which (apart from subsection (3)) has the effect that\u2014 a the fund of funds has (by virtue of disposals of its interest in the underlying scheme) disposed of at least 50% of the greatest amount invested for its purposes at any one time in the underlying scheme, or b the fund of fund's investment in the underlying scheme is worth less than whichever is the greater of\u2014 i \u00a31 million, or ii 5% of the total value of the investments made before the disposal for the purposes of the fund of funds in the underlying scheme. 5 In this Chapter,  \u201c fund of funds \u201d means an investment scheme in relation to which the condition in subsection (6) is met. 6 The condition is that when the scheme starts to invest it is reasonable to suppose that over the investing life of the scheme\u2014 a substantially all of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be invested in collective investment schemes of which the scheme holds less than 50% by value, b more than 50% of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be invested in investments which are held for 40 months or more, and c more than 75% of the total value invested in the scheme will be invested by external investors. 7 In determining whether subsection (6)(b) is met in relation to an investment scheme, apply the rule in subsection (3) to the scheme. 8 In this section,  \u201c significant investment \u201d, in relation to a collective investment scheme, means\u2014 a an investment of a least \u00a31 million in the scheme, or b an investment of at least 5% of the total amounts raised or to be raised from external investors in the scheme. 9 In this section,  \u201c qualifying investment \u201d means an investment made for the purposes of an investment scheme in a collective investment scheme (\u201c the underlying scheme \u201d) where\u2014 a the investment is held on the same terms as other investments made by external investors in the underlying scheme, b the fund of funds, together with any connected funds, does not hold more than 30% by value of the underlying scheme, c the underlying scheme has not made an investment in the fund of funds, d no person providing investment management services to the underlying scheme provides investment management services to the fund of funds, and e it is reasonable to suppose that the investment in the underlying scheme is not part of arrangements the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to reward any person involved in providing investment management services to the underlying scheme or a scheme connected with that underlying scheme. Secondary funds 809FZP 1 Section 809FZC(5) (disregard of intermediate holdings and holding structures) does not apply to investments acquired for the purposes of a secondary fund in a collective investment scheme (and, accordingly, such an investment is regarded as an investment in the collective investment scheme itself). 2 Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a secondary fund in relation to a collective investment scheme if it is reasonable to suppose that the main purpose or one of the main purposes of the making of any investment in any collective investment scheme for the purposes of the secondary fund is to reduce the proportion of carried interest arising to any person which is income-based carried interest. 3 Where by virtue of subsection (1) a secondary fund has a significant investment in a collective investment scheme (\u201c the underlying scheme \u201d)\u2014 a any qualifying investment acquired for the purposes of the fund in the underlying scheme after the time when the significant investment is acquired is to be regarded as having been made at that time, and b any disposal for the purposes of the fund of a qualifying investment in the underlying scheme after that time is to be regarded as not being made until a relevant disposal is made. 4 In subsection (3)(b)  \u201c relevant disposal \u201d means a disposal which (apart from subsection (3)) has the effect that\u2014 a the secondary fund has (by virtue of disposals of its interest in the underlying scheme) disposed of at least 50% of the greatest amount invested for its purposes at any one time in the underlying scheme, or b the secondary fund's investment in the underlying scheme is worth less than whichever is the greater of\u2014 i \u00a31 million, or ii 5% of the total value of the investments held immediately before the disposal for the purposes of the secondary fund in the underlying scheme. 5 In this Chapter,  \u201c secondary fund \u201d means an investment scheme in relation to which the condition in subsection (6) is met. 6 The condition is that when the scheme starts to invest it is reasonable to suppose that over the investing life of the scheme\u2014 a substantially all of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be in the acquisition of investments in, or the acquisition of portfolios of investments from, unconnected collective investment schemes, b more than 50% of the total value invested for the purposes of the scheme will be invested in investments which are held for 40 months or more, and c more than 75% of the total amount invested in the scheme will be invested by external investors. 7 In determining whether subsection (6)(b) is met in relation to an investment scheme, apply the rule in subsection (3) to the scheme. 8 In this section,  \u201c significant interest \u201d, in relation to a collective investment scheme, means\u2014 a an investment of at least \u00a31 million in the scheme, or b an investment of at least 5% of the total amounts raised or to be raised from external investors in the scheme. 9 In this section,  \u201c qualifying investment \u201d means an investment in a collective investment scheme (\u201c the underlying scheme \u201d) acquired for the purposes of a secondary fund where\u2014 a the investment acquired was originally made on the same terms as investments in the underlying scheme made by external investors, b the terms on which the investment was acquired or investments made in the underlying scheme were made by external investors have not significantly changed since the investment was acquired, c the secondary fund, together with any connected funds, does not hold more than 30% by value of the underlying scheme, d no person providing investment management services to the underlying scheme provides investment management services to the secondary fund, and e it is reasonable to suppose that the investment in the underlying scheme is not part of arrangements the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to reward any person involved in providing investment management services to the underlying scheme or a scheme connected with that underlying scheme. Direct lending funds Direct lending funds 809FZQ 1 Carried interest arising from an investment scheme which is a direct lending fund is income-based carried interest in its entirety. Subsections (2) to (4) apply for the purposes of this Chapter. 2 A direct lending fund is an investment scheme\u2014 a which is not a venture capital fund, significant equity stake fund, controlling equity stake fund or real estate fund, and b in relation to which it is reasonable to suppose that, when the scheme ceases to invest, a majority of the investments made for the purposes of the scheme (calculated by reference to value invested) will have been direct loans made by the scheme. 3 An investment scheme makes a direct loan if for the purposes of the scheme money is advanced at interest or for any other return determined by reference to the time value of money. 4 The acquisition of a direct loan is to be regarded as the making of a direct loan if the loan is acquired within the period of 120 days beginning with the day on which the money is first advanced. Direct lending funds: exception 809FZR 1 Section 809FZQ does not apply to carried interest arising from a direct lending fund if\u2014 a the fund is a limited partnership, b the carried interest is a sum falling within section 809EZD(2) or (3), and c it is reasonable to suppose that, when investments cease to be made for the purposes of the fund, at least 75% of the direct loans made by the fund (calculated by reference to value advanced) will have been qualifying loans. 2 In this section  \u201c qualifying loan \u201d means a direct loan made by an investment scheme where\u2014 a the borrower is not connected with the investment scheme, b the money is advanced under a genuine commercial loan agreement negotiated at arm's length, c repayments are fixed and determinable, d maturity is fixed, e the scheme has the positive intention and ability to hold the loan to maturity, and f the relevant term of the loan is at least four years. 3 In this section  \u201c relevant term \u201d, in relation to a loan, means the period which\u2014 a begins with the time when the money is advanced, and b ends with the time by which, under the terms of the loan, at least 75% of the principal due under the loan must be repaid. 4 For the purposes of determining the average holding period of a scheme, where\u2014 a a qualifying loan made by an investment scheme is repaid by the borrower to any extent before the end of 40 months from the time the loan is made, and b it is reasonable to suppose that the borrower's decision to repay was not affected by considerations relating to the application of this Chapter, the loan is, to the extent it is repaid by the borrower before the end of 40 months from the time it is made, to be treated as held for 40 months. 5 In determining for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) whether a sum falls within section 809EZD(2) or (3), read section 809EZD(4)(b) as if the reference to 6% were to 4%. 6 Section 809FZB applies to carried interest to which, by virtue of subsection (1), section 809FZQ does not apply. Conditionally exempt carried interest Conditionally exempt carried interest 809FZS 1 Carried interest which\u2014 a arises to an individual from an investment scheme, and b is conditionally exempt from income tax, is to be treated as if it were not income-based carried interest to any extent. 2 Carried interest is conditionally exempt from income tax if Conditions A to D are met. 3 Condition A is that the carried interest arises to the individual in the period of\u2014 a four years beginning with the day on which the scheme starts to invest, or b ten years beginning with that day if the carried interest is calculated on the realisation model. 4 Condition B is that the carried interest would, apart from this section, be income-based carried interest to any extent. 5 Condition C is that it is reasonable to suppose that, were the carried interest to arise to the individual at the relevant time (but by reference to the same relevant investments), it would not be income-based carried interest to any extent. 6 The  \u201crelevant time\u201d is whichever is the earliest of\u2014 a the time when it is reasonable to suppose that the investment scheme will be wound up; b the end of the period of four years beginning with the time when it is reasonable to suppose that the scheme will cease to invest; c the end of the period of\u2014 i four years beginning with the day on which the sum of carried interest arises to the individual, or ii ten years beginning with that day if the carried interest was calculated on the realisation model; d the end of the period of four years beginning with the end of the period by reference to which the amount of the carried interest was determined. 7 Subsection (5) does not affect what would otherwise be the time at which an investment is disposed of for the purposes of this Chapter. 8 Condition D is that the individual makes a claim under this section for the carried interest to be conditionally exempt from income tax. Carried interest which ceases to be conditionally exempt 809FZT 1 Carried interest which is conditionally exempt from income tax ceases to be conditionally exempt from income tax at whichever is the earliest of\u2014 a the time when the investment scheme is wound up; b the end of the period of four years beginning with the time the scheme ceases to invest; c the end of the period of\u2014 i four years beginning with the day on which the sum of carried interest arises to the individual, or ii ten years beginning with that day if the carried interest was calculated on the realisation model; d the end of the period of four years beginning with the end of the period by reference to which the amount of the carried interest is determined; e the time at which Condition C in section 809FZS(5) ceases to be met. 2 Carried interest which ceases to be conditionally exempt from income tax is to be treated as having been income-based carried interest at the time it arose to the individual if or to the extent that, had it arisen to the individual at the time it ceased to be conditionally exempt (but in relation to the same relevant investments) it would have been income-based carried interest. 3 All such assessments and adjustments of assessments are to be made as are necessary to give effect to subsection (2). 4 Any amount paid by way of capital gains tax in respect of carried interest which is conditionally exempt from income tax is to be treated as if it had been paid in respect of any income tax liability arising under subsection (2).

Treasury regulations 809FZX 1 The Treasury may by regulations make\u2014 a provision relating to the calculation of the average holding period in some or all cases; b provision repealing, or restricting the application of, section 809FZU (employment-related securities). 2 The provision referred to in subsection (1)(a) includes in particular\u2014 a provision for a method of calculating that period which is different from that in section 809FZC; b provision as to what is and is not to be regarded as an investment; c provision as to when an investment is to be regarded as made or disposed of; d anti-avoidance provision. 3 Regulations under this section may\u2014 a amend this Chapter; b make different provision for different purposes; c contain incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision and savings. \u201cReasonable to suppose\u201d 809FZY 1 For the purposes of this Chapter, in determining what it is reasonable to suppose in relation to an investment scheme, regard is to be had to all the circumstances. 2 Those circumstances include in particular any prospectus or other document which\u2014 a is made available to external investors in the investment scheme, and b on which external investors may reasonably be supposed to have relied or been able to rely.

91(4)(b) or (5)(b) determined by reference to the same royalty or other sum. 4B A credit equal to the company's liability to diverted profits tax for that accounting period which arises by virtue of section 88(5)(b) in respect of the royalty or other sum, to the extent that it is included in relevant taxable income for the purposes of section 91(4)(b) or (5)(b), is allowed against the company's total liability to diverted profits tax for that period. 4C Subsection (4D) applies where\u2014 a by reason of the payment of a royalty or other sum a company's liability to diverted profits tax for an accounting period includes liability arising by virtue of section 88(5)(b), b the royalty or other sum is paid to a person who is resident in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, and c under any relevant provision relief would have been due to that person had the avoided PE been a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom through which the company carried on the trade mentioned in section 86(1)(b). 4D Such credit as is just and reasonable having regard to the amount of the relief referred to in subsection (4C)(c) is allowed against the company's liability to

Relevant IP profits 357BF 1 This section applies for the purposes of determining the relevant IP profits of a trade of a company for an accounting period in a case where\u2014 a the accounting period begins on or after 1 July 2021, or b the company is a new entrant (see section 357A(11)). 2 To determine the relevant IP profits\u2014 Step 1  Take any amounts which are brought into account as credits in calculating the profits of the trade for the accounting period, other than any amounts of finance income (see section 357BG), and divide them into two  \u201cstreams\u201d, amounts of relevant IP income (see sections 357BH to 357BHC) and amounts that are not amounts of relevant IP income. The stream consisting of relevant IP income is  \u201cthe relevant IP income stream\u201d; the other stream is the  \u201cstandard income stream\u201d. Step 2  Divide the relevant IP income stream into  \u201crelevant IP income sub-streams\u201d so that each sub-stream is\u2014 a sub-stream consisting of income properly attributable to a particular qualifying IP right (an  \u201cindividual IP right sub-stream\u201d), a sub-stream consisting of income properly attributable to a particular kind of IP item (a  \u201cproduct sub-stream\u201d), or a sub-stream consisting of income properly attributable to a particular kind of IP process (a  \u201cprocess sub-stream\u201d). See subsection (5) for the meaning of  \u201cIP item\u201d and  \u201cIP process\u201d and see subsections (6) and (7) for further provision in connection with product sub-streams and process sub-streams. Step 3  Take any amounts which are brought into account as debits in calculating the profits of the trade for the accounting period, other than any excluded debits (see section 357BI), and allocate them on a just and reasonable basis between the standard income stream and each of the relevant IP income sub-streams. Step 4  Deduct from each relevant IP income sub-stream\u2014 the amounts allocated to the sub-stream at Step 3, and the routine return figure for the sub-stream (see section 357BJ). But see section 357BIA (which provides that certain amounts allocated to a relevant IP income sub-stream at Step 3 are not to be deducted from the sub-stream at this Step). Step 5  Deduct from each relevant IP income sub-stream which is greater than nil following Step 4 the marketing assets return figure for the sub-stream (see section 357BK). Step 6  Multiply the amount of each relevant IP income sub-stream (following the deductions required at Steps 4 and 5) by the R&D fraction for the sub-stream (see section 357BL). Step 7  Add together the amounts of the relevant IP income sub-streams (following Step 6). Step 8  If the company has made an election under section 357BM (which provides in certain circumstances for profits arising before the grant of a right to be treated as relevant IP profits), add to the amount given by Step 7 any amount determined in accordance with subsection (3) of that section. 3 If the amount given by subsection (2) is greater than nil, that amount is the relevant IP profits of the trade for the accounting period. 4 If the amount given by subsection (2) is less than nil, that amount is the relevant IP losses of the trade for the accounting period (see Chapter 5). 5 In this section\u2014 \u201c IP item \u201d means\u2014 an item in respect of which a qualifying IP right held by the company has been granted, or an item which incorporates one or more items within paragraph (a); \u201c IP process \u201d means\u2014 a process in respect of which a qualifying IP right held by the company has been granted, or a process which incorporates one or more processes within paragraph (a). 6 For the purposes of this section two or more IP items, or two or more IP processes, may be treated as being of a particular kind if they are intended to be, or are capable of being, used for the same or substantially the same purposes. 7 Income may be allocated at Step 2 of subsection (2) to a product sub-stream or process sub-stream only if\u2014 a it would not be reasonably practicable to apportion the income between individual IP right sub-streams, or b it would be reasonably practicable to do that but doing so would result in it not being reasonably practicable to apply any of the remaining steps in subsection (2). 8 Any reference in this section to a qualifying IP right held by the company includes a reference to a qualifying IP right in respect of which the company holds an exclusive licence. Finance income Finance income 357BG 1 For the purposes of this Part  \u201c finance income \u201d, in relation to a trade of a company, means\u2014 a any credits which are treated as receipts of the trade by virtue of\u2014 i section 297 of CTA 2009 (credits in respect of loan relationships), or ii section 573 of CTA 2009 (credits in respect of derivative contracts), b any amount which in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice falls to be recognised as arising from a financial asset, and c any return, in relation to an amount, which\u2014 i is produced for the company by an arrangement to which it is a party, and ii is economically equivalent to interest. 2 In subsection (1)\u2014 \u201c economically equivalent to interest \u201d is to be construed in accordance with section 486B(2) and (3) of CTA 2009, and \u201c financial asset \u201d means a financial asset as defined for the purposes of generally accepted accounting practice. 3 For the purposes of subsection (1)(c), the amount of a return is the amount which by virtue of the return would, in calculating the company's chargeable profits, be treated under section 486B of CTA 2009 (disguised interest to be regarded as profit from loan relationship) as profit arising to the company from a loan relationship. But, in calculating that profit for the purposes of this subsection, sections 486B(7) and 486C to 486E of that Act are to be ignored. Relevant IP income Relevant IP income 357BH 1 For the purposes of this Part  \u201c relevant IP income \u201d means income falling within any of the Heads set out in\u2014 a subsection (2) (sales income), b subsection (6) (licence fees), c subsection (7) (proceeds of sale etc), d subsection (8) (damages for infringement), and e subsection (9) (other compensation).

In this subsection  \u201c qualifying process \u201d means a process in respect of which a qualifying IP right held by the company has been granted. 7 Head 3 is any income arising from the sale or other disposal of a qualifying IP right or an exclusive licence in respect of such a right. 8 Head 4 is any amount received by the company in respect of an infringement, or alleged infringement, of a qualifying IP right held by the company at the time of the infringement or alleged infringement. 9 Head 5 is any amount of damages, proceeds of insurance or other compensation, other than an amount in respect of an infringement or alleged infringement of a qualifying IP right, which is received by the company in respect of an event and\u2014 a is paid in respect of any items that fell within subsection (2) at the time of that event, or b represents a loss of income which would, if received by the company at the time of that event, have been relevant IP income. 10 But income is not relevant IP income by virtue of subsection (8) or (9) unless the event in respect of which the income is received, or any part of that event, occurred at a time when\u2014 a the company was a qualifying company, and b an election under section 357A(1) had effect in relation to it. 11 In a case where the whole of that event does not occur at such a time, subsection (8) or (9) (as the case may be) applies only to so much of the amount received by the company in respect of the event as on a just and reasonable apportionment is properly attributable to such a time. 12 Any reference in this section to a qualifying IP right held by the company includes a reference to a qualifying IP right in respect of which the company holds an exclusive licence. Notional royalty 357BHA 1 This section applies where\u2014 a a company holds a qualifying IP right or an exclusive licence in respect of a qualifying IP right, b the qualifying IP right falls within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of section 357BB(1), and c the income of a trade of the company for an accounting period includes income (\u201cIP-derived income\u201d) which\u2014 i arises from things done by the company that involve the exploitation by the company of the qualifying IP right, and ii is not relevant IP income, finance income or excluded income. 2 The company may elect that the appropriate percentage of the IP-derived income is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as if it were relevant IP income. 3 The  \u201cappropriate percentage\u201d is the proportion of the IP-derived income which the company would pay another person (\u201cP\u201d) for the right to exploit the qualifying IP right in the accounting period concerned if the company were not otherwise able to exploit it. 4 For the purposes of determining the appropriate percentage under this section, assume that\u2014 a the company and P are dealing at arm's length, b the company, or the company and persons authorised by it, will have the right to exploit the qualifying IP right to the exclusion of any other person (including P), c the company will have the same rights in relation to the qualifying IP right as it actually has, d the right to exploit the qualifying IP right is conferred on the relevant day, e the appropriate percentage is determined at the beginning of the accounting period concerned, f the appropriate percentage will apply for each succeeding accounting period for which the company will have the right to exploit the qualifying IP right, and g no income other than IP-derived income will arise from anything done by the company that involves the exploitation by the company of the qualifying IP right. 5 In subsection (4)(d)  \u201c the relevant day \u201d means\u2014 a the first day of the accounting period concerned, or b if later, the day on which the company first began to hold the qualifying IP right or licence. 6 In determining the appropriate percentage, the company must act in accordance with\u2014 a Article 9 of the  OECD  Model Tax Convention, and b the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. 7 In this section  \u201c excluded income \u201d means any income falling within either of the Heads in section 357BHB. Excluded income 357BHB 1 For the purposes of this Part income falling within either of the Heads set out in the following subsections is not relevant IP income\u2014 a subsection (2) (ring fence income), b subsection (3) (income attributable to non-exclusive licences). 2 Head 1 is income arising from oil extraction activities or oil rights. In this subsection  \u201c oil extraction activities \u201d and  \u201c oil rights \u201d have the same meaning as in Part 8 (see sections 272 and 273). 3 Head 2 is income which on a just and reasonable apportionment is properly attributable to a licence (a  \u201cnon-exclusive licence\u201d) held by the company which\u2014 a is a licence in respect of an item or process, but b is not an exclusive licence in respect of a qualifying IP right. 4 In a case where\u2014 a a company holds an exclusive licence in respect of a qualifying IP right, and b the licence also confers on the company (or on the company and persons authorised by it) any right in respect of the invention otherwise than to the exclusion of all other persons, the licence is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as if it were two separate licences, one an exclusive licence that does not confer any such rights, and the other a non-exclusive licence conferring those rights. Mixed sources of income 357BHC 1 This section applies to any income that\u2014 a is mixed income, or b is paid under a mixed agreement. 2 \u201c Mixed income \u201d means the proceeds of sale where an item falling within subsection (2) of section 357BH and an item not falling within that subsection are sold together as, or as part of, a single unit for a single price. 3 A  \u201cmixed agreement\u201d is an agreement providing for\u2014 a one or more of the matters in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (4), and b one or more of the matters in paragraphs (d) to (g) of that subsection. 4 The matters are\u2014 a the sale of an item falling within section 357BH(2), b the grant of any right falling within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of section 357BH(6), c a sale or disposal falling within section 357BH(7), d the sale of any other item, e the grant of any other right, f any other sale or disposal, g the provision of any services. 5 So much of the income as on a just and reasonable apportionment is properly attributable to\u2014 a the sale of an item falling within section 357BH(2), b the grant of any right falling within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of section 357BH(6), or c a sale or disposal falling within section 357BH(7), is to be regarded for the purposes of this Part as relevant IP income. 6 But where the amount of income that on such an apportionment is properly attributable to any of the matters in paragraphs (d) to (g) of subsection (4) is a trivial proportion of the income to which this section applies, all of that income is to be regarded for the purposes of this Part as relevant IP income. Excluded debits etc Excluded debits 357BI For the purposes of this Part  \u201c excluded debits \u201d means\u2014 a the amount of any debits which are treated as expenses of a trade by virtue of\u2014 i section 297 of CTA 2009 (debits in respect of loan relationships), or ii section 573 of CTA 2009 (debits in respect of derivative contracts), b the amount of any additional deduction for an accounting period obtained by a company under Part 13 of CTA 2009 for expenditure on research and development in relation to a trade, c the amount of any additional deduction for an accounting period obtained by a company under Part 15A of CTA 2009 in respect of qualifying expenditure on a television programme, d the amount of any additional deduction for an accounting period obtained by a company under Part 15B of CTA 2009 in respect of qualifying expenditure on a video game, and e the amount of any additional deduction for an accounting period obtained by a company under Part 15C of CTA 2009 in respect of qualifying expenditure on a theatrical production. Certain amounts not to be deducted from sub-streams at Step 4 of section 357BF 357BIA 1 This section applies where a company enters into an arrangement with a person under which\u2014 a the person assigns to the company a qualifying IP right or grants or transfers to the company an exclusive licence in respect of a qualifying IP right, and b the company makes to the person an income-related payment. 2 A payment is an  \u201c income-related payment \u201d for the purposes of subsection (1) if\u2014 a the obligation to make the payment arises under the arrangement by reason of the amount of income the company has accrued which is properly attributable to the right or licence, or b the amount of the payment is determined under the arrangement by reference to the amount of income the company has accrued which is so attributable. 3 If the amount of the income-related payment is allocated to a relevant IP income sub-stream at Step 3 of section 357BF(2), the amount is not to be deducted from the sub-stream at Step 4 of section 357BF(2) unless the payment will not affect the R&D fraction for the sub-stream.\u201d Routine return figure Routine return figure 357BJ 1 This section applies for the purpose of calculating the routine return figure for a relevant IP income sub-stream established at Step 2 in section 357BF(2) in determining the relevant IP profits of a trade of a company for an accounting period. 2 The routine return figure for the sub-stream is 10% of the aggregate of any routine deductions which\u2014 a have been made by the company in calculating the profits of the trade for the accounting period, and b have been allocated to the sub-stream at Step 3 in section 357BF(2). For the meaning of  \u201croutine deductions\u201d, see sections 357BJA and 357BJB. 3 In a case where\u2014 a the company (\u201cC\u201d) is a member of a group, b another member of the group has incurred expenses on behalf of C, c had they been incurred by C, C would have made a deduction in respect of the expenses in calculating the profits of the trade for the accounting period, d the deduction would have been a routine deduction, and e the deduction would have been allocated to the sub-stream at Step 3 in section 357BF(2), C is to be treated for the purposes of subsection (2) as having made such a routine deduction and as having allocated the deduction to the sub-stream. 4 Where expenses have been incurred by any member of the group on behalf of C and any other member of the group, subsection (3) applies in relation to so much of the amount of the expenses as on a just and reasonable apportionment may properly be regarded as incurred on behalf of C. Routine deductions 357BJA 1 For the purposes of this Part,  \u201c routine deductions \u201d means deductions falling within any of the Heads set out in\u2014 a subsection (2) (capital allowances), b subsection (3) (costs of premises), c subsection (4) (personnel costs), d subsection (5) (plant and machinery costs), e subsection (6) (professional services), and f subsection (7) (miscellaneous services). This is subject to section 357BJB (deductions that are not routine deductions). 2 Head 1 is any allowances under  CAA  2001. 3 Head 2 is any deductions made by the company in respect of any premises occupied by the company. 4 Head 3 is any deductions made by the company in respect of\u2014 a any director or employee of the company, or b any externally provided workers. 5 Head 4 is any deductions made by the company in respect of any plant or machinery used by the company. 6 Head 5 is any deductions made by the company in respect of any of the following services\u2014 a legal services, other than IP-related services; b financial services, including\u2014 i insurance services, and ii valuation or actuarial services; c services provided in connection with the administration or management of the company's directors and employees; d any other consultancy services. 7 Head 6 is any deductions made by the company in respect of any of the following services\u2014 a the supply of water, fuel or power; b telecommunications services; c computing services, including computer software; d postal services; e the transportation of any items; f the collection, removal and disposal of refuse. 8 In this section\u2014 \u201c externally provided worker \u201d has the same meaning as in Part 13 of CTA 2009 (see section 1128 of that Act), \u201c IP-related services \u201d means services provided in connection with\u2014 any application for a right to which this Part applies, or any proceedings relating to the enforcement of any such right, \u201c premises \u201d includes any land, \u201c telecommunications service \u201d means any service that consists in the provision of access to, and of facilities for making use of, any telecommunication system (whether or not one provided by the person providing the service), and \u201c telecommunication system \u201d means any system (including the apparatus comprised in it) which exists for the purpose of facilitating the transmission of communications by any means involving the use of electrical or electromagnetic energy. 9 The Treasury may by regulations amend this section. Deductions that are not routine deductions 357BJB 1 For the purposes of this Part a deduction is not a  \u201croutine deduction\u201d if it falls within any of the Heads set out in\u2014 a subsection (2) (loan relationships and derivative contracts), b subsection (3) (R&D expenses), c subsection (4) (capital allowances for R&D or patents), d subsection (5) (R&D-related employee share acquisitions), e subsection (8) (television production expenditure), f subsection (9) (video games development expenditure). 2 Head 1 is any debits which are treated as expenses of the trade by virtue of\u2014 a section 297 of CTA 2009 (debits in respect of loan relationships), or b section 573 of CTA 2009 (debits in respect of derivative contracts). 3 Head 2 is\u2014 a the amount of any expenditure on research and development in relation to the trade\u2014 i for which an additional deduction for the accounting period is obtained by the company under Part 13 of CTA 2009, or ii in respect of which the company is entitled to an R&D expenditure credit for the accounting period under Chapter 6A of Part 3 of CTA 2009, and b where the company obtains an additional deduction as mentioned in paragraph (a)(i), the amount of that additional deduction. 4 Head 3 is any allowances under\u2014 a Part 6 of CAA 2001 (research and development allowances), or b Part 8 of CAA 2001 (patent allowances). 5 Head 4 is the appropriate proportion of any deductions allowed under Part 12 of CTA 2009 (relief for employee share acquisitions) in a case where\u2014 a shares are acquired by an employee or another person because of the employee's employment by the company, and b the employee is wholly or partly engaged directly and actively in relevant research and development (within the meaning of section 1042 of CTA 2009). 6 In subsection (5)  \u201c the appropriate proportion \u201d, in relation to a deduction allowed in respect of an employee, is the proportion of the staffing costs in respect of the employee which are attributable to relevant research and development for the purposes of Part 13 of CTA 2009 (see section 1124 of that Act). \u201c Staffing costs \u201d has the same meaning as in that Part (see section 1123 of that Act). 7 Subsections (5) and (6) of section 1124 of CTA 2009 apply for the purposes of subsection (5)(b) as they apply for the purposes of that section. 8 Head 5 is\u2014 a the amount of any qualifying expenditure on a television programme for which an additional deduction for the accounting period is obtained by the company under Part 15A of CTA 2009, and b the amount of that additional deduction. 9 Head 6 is\u2014 a the amount of any qualifying expenditure on a video game for which an additional deduction for the accounting period is obtained by the company under Part 15B of CTA 2009, and b the amount of that additional deduction. 10 The Treasury may by regulations amend this section. Marketing assets return figure Marketing assets return figure 357BK 1 The marketing assets return figure for a relevant IP income sub-stream is\u2014 NMR \u2212 AMR where\u2014 NMR is the notional marketing royalty in respect of the sub-stream (see section 357BKA), and AMR is the actual marketing royalty in respect of the sub-stream (see section 357BKB). 2 Where\u2014 a AMR is greater than NMR, or b the difference between NMR and AMR is less than 10% of the amount of the relevant IP income sub-stream following the deductions required by Step 4 in section 357BF(2), the marketing assets return figure for the sub-stream is nil. Notional marketing royalty 357BKA 1 The notional marketing royalty in respect of a relevant IP income sub-stream is the appropriate percentage of the income allocated to that sub-stream at Step 2 in section 357BF(2). 2 The  \u201cappropriate percentage\u201d is the proportion of that income which the company would pay another person (\u201cP\u201d) for the right to exploit the relevant marketing assets in the accounting period concerned if the company were not otherwise able to exploit them. 3 For the purposes of this section a marketing asset is a  \u201c relevant marketing asset \u201d in relation to a relevant IP income sub-stream if the sub-stream includes any income arising from things done by the company that involve the exploitation by the company of that marketing asset. 4 For the purpose of determining the appropriate percentage under this section, assume that\u2014 a the company and P are dealing at arm's length, b the company, or the company and persons authorised by it, will have the right to exploit the relevant marketing assets to the exclusion of any other person (including P), c the company will have the same rights in relation to the relevant marketing assets as it actually has, d the right to exploit the relevant marketing assets is conferred on the relevant day, e the appropriate percentage is determined at the beginning of the accounting period concerned, f the appropriate percentage will apply for each succeeding accounting period for which the company will have the right to exploit the relevant marketing assets, and g no income other than income within the relevant IP income sub-stream will arise from anything done by the company that involves the exploitation by the company of the relevant marketing assets. 5 In subsection (4)(d)  \u201c the relevant day \u201d, in relation to a relevant marketing asset, means\u2014 a the first day of the accounting period concerned, or b if later, the day on which the company first acquired the relevant marketing asset or the right to exploit the asset. 6 In determining the appropriate percentage, the company must act in accordance with\u2014 a Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, and b the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. 7 In this section  \u201c marketing asset \u201d means any of the following (whether or not capable of being transferred or assigned)\u2014 a anything in respect of which proceedings for passing off could be brought, including a registered trade mark (within the meaning of the Trade Marks Act 1994), b anything that corresponds to a marketing asset within paragraph (a) and is recognised under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, c any signs or indications (so far as not falling within paragraph (a) or (b)) which may serve, in trade, to designate the geographical origin of goods or services, and d any information which relates to customers or potential customers of the company, or any other member of a group of which the company is a member, and is intended to be used for marketing purposes. Actual marketing royalty 357BKB 1 The actual marketing royalty for a relevant IP income sub-stream is the aggregate of any sums which\u2014 a were paid by the company for the purposes of acquiring any relevant marketing assets or the right to exploit any such assets, and b have been allocated to the sub-stream at Step 3 in section 357BF(2). 2 In this section  \u201c relevant marketing asset \u201d has the same meaning as in section 357BKA. R&D fraction Introduction 357BL 1 Sections 357BLA to 357BLH apply for the purpose of determining the R&D fraction for a relevant IP income sub-stream established at Step 2 in section 357BF(2) in determining the relevant IP profits of a trade of a company for an accounting period. 2 In sections 357BLA to 357BLH, references to  \u201cthe sub-stream\u201d,  \u201cthe trade\u201d,  \u201cthe company\u201d and  \u201cthe accounting period\u201d are to the relevant IP income sub-stream, the trade, the company and the accounting period referred to in subsection (1). The R&D fraction 357BLA 1 The R&D fraction for the sub-stream is the lesser of 1 and\u2014 ( D + S1 ) \u00d7 1.3 D + S1 + S2 + A where\u2014 D is the company's qualifying expenditure on relevant R&D undertaken in-house (see section 357BLB), S1 is the company's qualifying expenditure on relevant R&D sub-contracted to unconnected persons (see section 357BLC), S2 is the company's qualifying expenditure on relevant R&D sub-contracted to connected persons (see section 357BLD), and A is the company's qualifying expenditure on the acquisition of relevant qualifying IP rights (see section 357BLE). 2 This section is subject to section 357BLH (R&D fraction: increase for exceptional circumstances).

Qualifying expenditure on relevant R&D sub-contracted to connected persons 357BLD 1 In section 357BLA, the company's  \u201c qualifying expenditure on relevant R&D sub-contracted to connected persons \u201d means the total of\u2014 a any expenditure which is  \u201cqualifying expenditure on relevant R&D sub-contracted to connected persons\u201d as a result of section 357BLB(4) or 357BLC(3) (certain expenditure attributed to company's foreign permanent establishments), and b the expenditure incurred by the company during the relevant period in making payments within subsection (2). 2 A payment is within this subsection if\u2014 a it is made to a person in respect of relevant research and development contracted out by the company to the person, and b the company and the person are connected (within the meaning given by section 1122). 3 Where a payment is made to a person in respect of relevant research and development contracted out to the person and in respect of other matters, so much of the payment as is properly attributable to other matters is to be disregarded for the purposes of this section. Qualifying expenditure on acquisition of relevant qualifying IP rights 357BLE 1 In section 357BLA, the company's  \u201c qualifying expenditure on the acquisition of relevant qualifying IP rights \u201d means the expenditure incurred by the company in making during the relevant period payments within any of subsections (2), (3) and (4). 2 A payment is within this subsection if it is made to a person in respect of the assignment by that person to the company of a relevant qualifying IP right. 3 A payment is within this subsection if it is made to a person in respect of the grant or transfer by that person to the company of an exclusive licence in respect of a relevant qualifying IP right. 4 A payment is within this subsection if\u2014 a it is made to a person in respect of the disclosure by that person to the company of any item or process, and b the company applies for and is granted a relevant qualifying IP right in respect of that item or process (or any item or process derived from it). 5 Where the company has incurred expenditure in making a series of payments to a person in respect of a single assignment, grant, transfer or disclosure, each of the payments in the series is to be treated for the purposes of this section as having been made on the date on which the first payment in the series was made. 6 \u201c Relevant qualifying IP right \u201d means\u2014 a in a case where the sub-stream is an individual IP right sub-stream, the qualifying IP right to which the income in the sub-stream is attributable, b in a case where the sub-stream is a product sub-stream, a qualifying IP right granted in respect of an item\u2014 i to which income in the sub-stream is attributable, or ii which is incorporated in an item to which income in the sub-stream is attributable, or c in a case where the sub-stream is a process sub-stream, a qualifying IP right granted in respect of a process\u2014 i to which income in the sub-stream is attributable, or ii which is incorporated in a process to which income in the sub-stream is attributable. Meaning of the  \u201crelevant period\u201d etc 357BLF 1 Subsections (2) to (6) define  \u201c the relevant period \u201d for the purposes of sections 357BLB to 357BLE. 2 The  \u201crelevant period\u201d is the period which\u2014 a ends with the last day of the accounting period, and b begins on the relevant day or such earlier day as the company may elect. This is subject to subsection (6). 3 The  \u201crelevant day\u201d is 1 July 2013 in a case where\u2014 a the accounting period begins before 1 July 2021, and b the company is a new entrant (see section 357A(11)). 4 The  \u201crelevant day\u201d is 1 July 2016 in any other case. 5 A day elected under subsection (2)(b) must not be more than 20 years before the last day of the accounting period. 6 If the last day of the accounting period is, or is after, 1 July 2036 the  \u201crelevant period\u201d is the period of 20 years ending with that day. 7 Expenditure incurred by the company is to be treated for the purposes of sections 357BLB to 357BLD as incurred during the relevant period if (and only if) the expenditure is allowable as a deduction in calculating for corporation tax purposes the profits of the trade for an accounting period which falls, in whole or in part, within the relevant period. Cases where the company is a new entrant with insufficient information about pre-enactment expenditure 357BLG 1 This section applies if\u2014 a the accounting period begins before 1 July 2021 and the company is a new entrant (so that subsection (3) of section 357BLF applies), and b the company has insufficient information about its expenditure in the period which begins with 1 July 2013 and ends with 30 June 2016 to be able to calculate the R&D fraction for the sub-stream. 2 If the accounting period begins on or after 1 July 2019, the company may elect that, for the purposes of enabling it to determine the R&D fraction for the sub-stream, section 357BLF is to have effect as if in subsection (3) for  \u201c1 July 2013\u201d there were substituted  \u201c                                  1 July 2016                                \u201d . 3 If the accounting period begins before 1 July 2019 the company may elect that, for the purposes of enabling it to determine the R&D fraction for the sub-stream, sections 357BL to 357BLE are to have effect as if\u2014 a any reference in those sections to the relevant period were to the period of three years ending with the last day of the accounting period, b in section 357BLB, for subsections (5) and (6) there were substituted\u2014 5 In this section and sections 357BLC and 357BLD,  \u201c relevant research and development \u201d means research and development (within the meaning of section 1138) which relates to the trade. , and c in section 357BLE\u2014 i in each of subsections (2), (3) and (4) the word  \u201crelevant\u201d were omitted, and ii subsection (6) were omitted. R&D fraction: increase for exceptional circumstances 357BLH 1 The company may elect to increase the R&D fraction for the sub-stream by the amount mentioned in subsection (2) if (but for the increase)\u2014 a it would not be less than 0.325, and b it would, because of exceptional circumstances, be less than the value fraction for the sub-stream (see subsection (3)). 2 The amount of the increase referred to in subsection (1) is the amount which is equal to the difference between the R&D fraction (before the increase) and the value fraction. 3 The  \u201cvalue fraction\u201d for the sub-stream is the fraction which, on a just and reasonable assessment, represents the proportion of the value of the relevant qualifying IP rights which is properly attributable to research and development undertaken at any time\u2014 a by the company itself, or b on behalf of the company by persons not connected with it. 4 An election under subsection (1) is made by the company giving notice to an officer of Revenue and Customs. 5 The notice must be given on or before the last day on which an amendment of the company's tax return for the accounting period could be made under paragraph 15 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998. 6 In this section\u2014 \u201c relevant qualifying IP rights \u201d has the same meaning as in section 357BLE, and \u201c research and development \u201d has the meaning given by section 1138. 7 Section 1122 (meaning of  \u201cconnected\u201d persons\u201d) applies for the purposes of this section. Profits arising before grant of right Profits arising before grant of right 357BM 1 This section applies where a company\u2014 a holds a right mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of section 357BB(1) (rights to which this Part applies) or an exclusive licence in respect of such a right, or b would hold such a right or licence but for the fact that the company disposed of any rights in the invention or (as the case may be) the licence before the right was granted. 2 The company may elect that, for the purposes of determining the relevant IP profits of a trade of the company for the accounting period in which the right is granted, there is to be added the amount determined in accordance with subsection (3) (the  \u201c                                  additional amount                                \u201d ). 3 The additional amount is the difference between\u2014 a the aggregate of the relevant IP profits of the trade for each relevant accounting period, and b the aggregate of what the relevant IP profits of the trade for each relevant accounting period would have been if the right had been granted on the relevant day. 4 For the purposes of determining the additional amount, the amount of any relevant IP profits to which section 357A does not apply by virtue of Chapter 5 (relevant IP losses) is to be disregarded. 5 In this section  \u201c relevant accounting period \u201d means\u2014 a the accounting period of the company in which the right is granted, and b any earlier accounting period of the company which meets the conditions in subsection (6). 6 The conditions mentioned in subsection (5)(b) are\u2014 a that it is an accounting period for which an election made by the company under section 357A(1) has effect, b that it is an accounting period for which the company is a qualifying company, and c that it ends on or after the relevant day. 7 In this section  \u201cthe relevant day\u201d is the later of\u2014 a the first day of the period of 6 years ending with the day on which the right is granted, and b the day on which\u2014 i the application for the grant of the right was filed, or ii in the case of a company that holds an exclusive licence in respect of the right, the licence was granted. 8 Where the company would be a qualifying company for an accounting period but for the fact that the right had not been granted at any time during that accounting period, the company is to be treated for the purposes of this section as if it were a qualifying company for that accounting period. 9 Where the company would be a qualifying company for the accounting period in which the right was granted but for the fact that the company disposed of the rights or licence mentioned in subsection (1)(b) before the right was granted, the company is to be treated for the purposes of section 357A as if it were a qualifying company for that accounting period. Small claims treatment Small claims treatment 357BN 1 This section applies where\u2014 a a company carries on only one trade during an accounting period, b section 357BF applies for the purposes of determining the relevant IP profits of the trade for the accounting period, and c the qualifying residual profit of the trade for the accounting period does not exceed whichever is the greater of\u2014 i \u00a31,000,000, and ii the relevant maximum for the accounting period. 2 The company may make any of the following elections for the accounting period\u2014 a a notional royalty election (see section 357BNA), b a small claims figure election (see section 357BNB), and c a global streaming election (see section 357BNC). This is subject to subsections (3) and (4). 3 The company may not make a notional royalty election, a small claims figure election or a global streaming election for the accounting period if\u2014 a the qualifying residual profit of the trade for the accounting period exceeds \u00a31,000,000, b section 357BF applied for the purposes of determining the relevant IP profits of the trade for any previous accounting period beginning within the relevant 4-year period, and c the company did not make a notional royalty election, a small claims figure election or (as the case may be) a global streaming election for that previous accounting period. 4 The company may not make a small claims figure election for the accounting period if\u2014 a the qualifying residual profit of the trade for the accounting period exceeds \u00a31,000,000, b section 357C or 357DA applied for the purposes of determining the relevant IP profits of the trade for any previous accounting period beginning within the relevant 4-year period, and c the company did not make an election under section 357CL for small claims treatment for that previous accounting period. 5 In subsections (3) and (4)  \u201c the relevant 4-year period \u201d means the period of 4 years ending with the beginning of the accounting period mentioned in subsection (1)(a). 6 For the purposes of this section, the  \u201cqualifying residual profit\u201d of a trade of a company for an accounting period is the amount which (assuming the company did not make an election under this section) would be equal to the aggregate of the relevant IP income sub-streams established at Step 2 in section 357BF(2) in determining the relevant IP profits of the trade for the accounting period, following the deductions from those sub-streams required by Step 4 in section 357BF(2) (ignoring the amount of any sub-stream which is not greater than nil following those deductions). 7 For the purposes of this section, the  \u201crelevant maximum\u201d for an accounting period of a company is\u2014 a in a case where no company is a related 51% group company of the company in the accounting period, \u00a33,000,000; b in a case where one or more companies are related 51% group companies of the company in the accounting period, the amount given by the formula\u2014 \u00a3 3,000,000 ( 1 + N ) where N is the number of those related 51% group companies in relation to which an election under section 357A(1) has effect for the accounting period. 8 For an accounting period of less than 12 months, the relevant maximum is proportionally reduced. Notional royalty election 357BNA 1 Subsection (2) applies where a company has made a notional royalty election for an accounting period under section 357BN(2)(a). 2 In its application for the purposes of determining the relevant IP profits of the trade of the company for the accounting period, section 357BHA (notional royalty) has effect as if\u2014 a in subsection (2) for  \u201cthe appropriate percentage\u201d there were substituted  \u201c                                      75%                                    \u201d , and b subsections (3) to (6) were omitted. Small claims figure election 357BNB 1 Subsection (2) applies where a company has made a small claims figure election for an accounting period under section 357BN(2)(b). 2 In its application for the purposes of determining the relevant IP profits of the trade of the company for the accounting period, section 357BF(2) (steps for calculating relevant IP profits) has effect as if in Step 5\u2014 a for  \u201cmarketing assets return figure\u201d there was substituted  \u201c                                      small claims figure                                    \u201d , and b for  \u201c(see section 357BK)\u201d there was substituted  \u201c                                      (see section 357BNB(3))                                    \u201d . 3 Subsections (4) to (9) apply for the purpose of calculating the small claims figure for a relevant IP income sub-stream established at Step 2 in section 357BF(2) in determining the relevant IP profits of a trade of a company for an accounting period. 4 If 75% of the qualifying residual profit of the trade for the accounting period is lower than the small claims threshold, the small claims figure for the sub-stream is 25% of the amount of the sub-stream following Step 4 in section 357BF(2). 5 If 75% of the qualifying residual profit of the trade for the accounting period is higher than the small claims threshold, the small claims figure for the sub-stream is the amount given by\u2014 A \u2212 ( A QRP \u00d7 SCT ) where\u2014 A is the amount of the sub-stream following the deductions required by Step 4 in section 357BF(2), QRP is the qualifying residual profit of the trade of the company for the accounting period, and SCT is the small claims threshold. 6 If no company is a related 51% group company of the company in the accounting period, the small claims threshold is \u00a31,000,000. 7 If one or more companies are related 51% group companies of the company in the accounting period, the small claims threshold is\u2014 \u00a3 1,000,000 ( 1 + N ) where N is the number of those related 51% group companies in relation to which an election under section 357A(1) has effect for the accounting period. 8 For an accounting period of less than 12 months, the small claims threshold is proportionately reduced. 9 Subsection (6) of section 357BN (meaning of  \u201cqualifying residual profit\u201d) applies for the purposes of subsection (4) and (5) of this section. Global streaming election 357BNC 1 Subsection (2) applies where a company has made a global streaming election for an accounting period under section 357BN(2)(c). 2 In its application for the purpose of determining the relevant IP profits of the trade of the company for the accounting period, this Chapter has effect with the following modifications. 3 In subsection (2) of section 357BF (relevant IP profits)\u2014 a omit Step 2, b in Step 3 for  \u201ceach of the relevant IP income sub-streams\u201d substitute  \u201c                                      the relevant IP income stream                                    \u201d , c in Step 4\u2014 i in the words before paragraph (a), for  \u201ceach\u201d substitute  \u201c                                          the                                        \u201d , ii for  \u201csub-stream\u201d, in each place it occurs, substitute  \u201c                                          stream                                        \u201d , d in Step 5\u2014 i at the beginning insert  \u201c                                          If the relevant IP income stream is greater than nil following Step 4,                                        \u201d , ii for the words from  \u201ceach\u201d to  \u201cStep 4\u201d substitute  \u201c                                          the stream                                        \u201d , iii for  \u201csub-stream\u201d, in the second place it occurs, substitute  \u201c                                          stream                                        \u201d , e in Step 6\u2014 i for  \u201ceach relevant IP income sub-stream\u201d substitute  \u201c                                          the relevant IP income stream                                        \u201d , ii for  \u201csub-stream\u201d, in the second place it occurs, substitute  \u201c                                          stream                                        \u201d , f omit Step 7, and g in Step 8 for  \u201cgiven by Step 7\u201d substitute  \u201c                                      of the relevant IP income stream following Step 6                                    \u201d . 4 In subsection (3) of that section for  \u201cgiven by\u201d substitute  \u201c                                  of the relevant IP income stream following the Steps in                                \u201d . 5 In subsection (4) of that section for  \u201cgiven by\u201d substitute  \u201c                                  of the relevant IP income stream following the Steps in                                \u201d . 6 Omit subsections (5) to (7) of that section. 7 In section 357BIA(3) (certain amounts not to be deducted from sub-streams at Step 4 of section 357BF)\u2014 a for  \u201ca relevant IP income sub-stream\u201d substitute  \u201c                                      the relevant IP income stream                                    \u201d ;

CHAPTER 2B Relevant IP profits: cases mentioned in section 357A(7): income from new IP Relevant IP profits 357BO 1 Section 357BF applies, with the modifications set out in section 357BQ, for the purposes of determining the relevant IP profits of a trade of a company for an accounting period in a case where\u2014 a the accounting period begins before 1 July 2021, b the company is not a new entrant (see section 357A(11)), and c any amount of relevant IP income brought into account as a credit in calculating the profits of the trade for the accounting period is properly attributable to a new qualifying IP right (see section 357BP). 2 Where it is necessary for the purposes of section 357BF, as applied by this section, to determine the R&D fraction for a relevant IP income sub-stream, the company concerned is to be treated for the purposes of sections 357BLF and 357BLG as if it were a new entrant. 3 Where section 357BF applies by reason of this section for the purposes of determining the relevant IP profits of a trade of a company for an accounting period, the company may not make a global streaming election for the accounting period under section 357BN(2)(c). Meaning of  \u201cnew qualifying IP right\u201d and  \u201cold qualifying IP right\u201d 357BP 1 This section applies for the purposes of this Part. 2 \u201c New qualifying IP right \u201d, in relation to a company, means a qualifying IP right which meets condition A, B or C. 3 \u201c Old qualifying IP right \u201d, in relation to a company, means a qualifying IP right which does not meet any of those conditions. 4 Condition A is that the right was granted or issued to the company in response to an application filed on or after the relevant date. 5 Condition B is that the right was assigned to the company on or after the relevant date. 6 Condition C is that an exclusive licence in respect of the right was granted to the company on or after the relevant date. 7 The  \u201c relevant date \u201d for the purposes of subsections (4), (5) and (6) is 1 July 2016; but this is subject to subsection (8). 8 The  \u201c relevant date \u201d for the purposes of subsections (5) and (6) is 2 January 2016 if\u2014 a the company and the person who assigned the right or granted the licence were connected at the time of the assignment or grant, b the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the assignment of the right or the grant of the licence was the avoidance of a foreign tax, c the person who assigned the right or granted the licence was not within the charge to corporation tax at the time of the assignment or grant, and d the person who assigned the right or granted the licence was not liable at the time of the assignment or grant to a foreign tax which is designated for the purposes of this section by regulations made by the Treasury. 9 Regulations may be made under subsection (8)(d) which designate a foreign tax only if it appears to the Treasury that the tax may be charged at a reduced rate under provisions of the law of the country or territory concerned which correspond to the provisions of this Part. 10 Regulations may not be made under subsection (8)(d) after 31 December 2016. 11 In this section  \u201c foreign tax \u201d means a tax under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom. 12 Section 1122 (meaning of  \u201cconnected\u201d persons) applies for the purposes of this section. The modifications 357BQ 1 The modifications of section 357BF referred to in section 357BO(1) are as follows. 2 Omit subsection (1). 3 In subsection (2)\u2014 a in Step 2\u2014 i before paragraph (a) insert\u2014 aa a sub-stream consisting of income properly attributable to old qualifying IP rights (\u201can old IP rights sub-stream\u201d), , ii in paragraph (a) before  \u201cqualifying IP right\u201d insert  \u201c                                        new                                      \u201d , iii in the words after paragraph (c) for  \u201cand (7)\u201d substitute  \u201c                                        to (7E)                                      \u201d , b in Step 6, for  \u201crelevant IP income sub-stream\u201d substitute  \u201c                                    individual IP right sub-stream, each product sub-stream and each process sub-stream                                  \u201d , and c for Step 7 substitute\u2014 Step 7                                      Add together\u2014                                     a the amount of any old IP rights sub-stream (following Steps 4 and 5), and b the amount of each of the individual IP right sub-streams, each of the product sub-streams and each of the process sub-streams (following Step 6). 4 In subsection (7) for paragraph (a) substitute\u2014 a it would not be reasonably practicable to apportion the income between\u2014 i individual IP rights sub-streams, or ii individual IP rights sub-streams and an old IP rights sub-stream, or . 5 After subsection (7) insert\u2014 7A Subsections (7B) to (7E) apply where\u2014 a income which is properly attributable to an IP item or IP process may in accordance with subsection (7) be allocated at Step 2 of subsection (2) to a product sub-stream or process sub-stream, and b the IP item or IP process incorporates\u2014 i at least one item or process in respect of which an old qualifying IP right held by the company has been granted, and ii at least one item or process in respect of which a new qualifying IP right held by the company has been granted. 7B If\u2014 a the value of the IP item or IP process is wholly or mainly attributable to the incorporation in it of the items or processes referred to in subsection (7A)(b)(i), or b the old IP percentage for the IP item or IP process is 80% or more, the income properly attributable to the IP item or IP process may be treated as if it were properly attributable to old qualifying IP rights only; and, accordingly, the income may be allocated at Step 2 of subsection (2) to an old qualifying IP rights sub-stream (rather than to a product sub-stream or process sub-stream). 7C If the old IP percentage for the IP item or IP process is less than 80% but not less than 20%, that percentage of the income which is properly attributable to the IP item or IP process may be treated as if it were properly attributable to old qualifying IP rights only; and, accordingly, that percentage of the income may be allocated at Step 2 of subsection (2) to an old IP rights sub-stream (and the remainder is to be allocated to a product sub-stream or process sub-stream). 7D Where by reason of subsection (7C) only part of the income properly attributable to the IP item or IP process is allocated to a product sub-stream or process sub-stream, the IP item or IP process is to be treated, in determining the R&D fraction for the sub-stream, as if it did not incorporate the items or processes referred to in subsection (7A)(b)(i). 7E For the purposes of subsection (7B) and (7C), the  \u201cold IP percentage\u201d for an IP item or IP process is the percentage found by the following calculation\u2014 O T \u00d7 100 where\u2014 O is the number of items or processes incorporated in the IP item or IP process in respect of which an old qualifying IP right held by the company has been granted, and T is the number of items or processes incorporated in the IP item or IP process in respect of which an old or a new qualifying IP right held by the company has been granted. 4 In section 357FB (tax advantage schemes)\u2014 a in subsection (2)(b) (list of ways by which deductions can be inflated)\u2014 i omit  \u201cor\u201d at the end of sub-paragraph (ii), and ii after sub-paragraph (iii) insert , or                             iv an R&D fraction (see subsection (4A)) being greater than it would be but for the scheme. , and b after subsection (4) insert\u2014 4A The reference in subsection (2)(b)(iv) to an R&D fraction is a reference to such a fraction as is mentioned at Step 6 of section 357BF(2). 5 After section 357GC insert\u2014 Transferred trades Application of this Part in relation to transferred trades 357GCA 1 Where\u2014 a a company (\u201c the transferor \u201d) ceases to carry on a trade which involves the exploitation of a qualifying IP right (\u201cthe relevant qualifying IP right\u201d), b the transferor assigns the relevant qualifying IP right, or grants or transfers an exclusive licence in respect of it, to another company (\u201c the transferee \u201d), and c the transferee begins to carry on the trade, the following provisions apply in determining under this Part the relevant IP profits of the trade carried on by the transferee. 2 The transferee is to be treated as not being a new entrant if\u2014 a an election under section 357A(1) has effect in relation to the transferor on the date of the assignment, grant or transfer mentioned in subsection (1)(b) (\u201c the transfer date \u201d), and b the first accounting period of the transferor for which that election had effect began before 1 July 2016. 3 The relevant qualifying IP right is to be treated as being an old qualifying IP right in relation to the transferee if by reason of section 357BP it is an old qualifying IP right in relation to the transferor. 4 Expenditure incurred prior to the transfer date by the transferor which is attributable to relevant research and development undertaken by the transferor is to be treated for the purposes of section 357BLB as if it is expenditure incurred by the transferee which is attributable to relevant research and development undertaken by the transferee. 5 Expenditure incurred prior to the transfer date by the transferor in making a payment to a person in respect of relevant research and development contracted out by the transferor to that person is to be treated for the purposes of sections 357BLC and 357BLD as if it is expenditure incurred by the transferee in making a payment to that person in respect of relevant research and development contracted out by the transferee to that person. 6 Expenditure incurred prior to the transfer date by the transferor in making a payment in connection with the relevant qualifying IP right which is within subsection (2), (3) or (4) of section 357BLE is to be treated for the purposes of that section as if it is expenditure incurred by the transferee in making a payment in connection with that right which is within one of those subsections. 7 Expenditure incurred by the transferee in making a payment to the transferor in respect of the assignment, grant or transfer mentioned in subsection (1)(b) is to be ignored for the purposes of section 357BLE. 8 In this section\u2014 \u201c trade \u201d includes part of a trade, and \u201c relevant research and development \u201d means research and development which relates to the relevant qualifying IP right. 9 For the purposes of this section research and development  \u201crelates\u201d to the relevant qualifying IP right if\u2014 a it creates, or contributes to the creation of the invention, b it is undertaken for the purpose of developing the invention, c it is undertaken for the purpose of developing ways in which the invention may be used or applied, or d it is undertaken for the purpose of developing any item or process incorporating the invention. 6 Schedule 9 contains amendments consequential on this section. 7 The amendments made by this section have effect in relation to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2016. 8 Subsection (9) applies where a company has an accounting period (\u201cthe straddling period\u201d) which begins before, and ends on or after, 1 July 2016 or 1 July 2021 (\u201c the relevant date \u201d). 9 For the purposes of this section and Part 8A of CTA 2010\u2014 a so much of the straddling period as falls before the relevant date, and so much of that period as falls on or after that date, are treated as separate accounting periods, and b any amounts brought into account for the purposes of calculating for corporation tax purposes the profits of any trade of the company for the straddling period are apportioned to the two separate accounting periods on such basis as is just and reasonable. 10 Subsection (11) applies if\u2014 a an election is made by a company under section 357A(1) of CTA 2010, and b the notice under section 357G of that Act specifies the accounting period of the company which ends on 30 June 2016, or any earlier accounting period, as being the first accounting period for which the election is to have effect. 11 Nothing in section 357GA(5) prevents the election having effect in relation to the accounting period of the company which ends on 30 June 2016 or any subsequent accounting period. 12 Subsection (13) applies to an amount of relevant IP income of a company if\u2014 a the company is not a new entrant, b the income is properly attributable to a new qualifying IP right which was assigned to the company, or in respect of which an exclusive licence was granted to the company, during the period beginning on 2 January 2016 and ending on 1 July 2016, and c the income accrued to the company during the period beginning on 1 July 2016 and ending on 1 January 2017. 13 The income is to be treated for the purposes of Part 8A of CTA 2010 as being properly attributable to an old qualifying IP right. 14 Expressions used in subsections (12) and (13) and in Part 8A of CTA 2010 have the meaning they have in that Part."}, {"act": "Finance Act 2016", "year": 2016, "section": "65",

dwelling-house (\u201cthe old item\u201d), b P incurs expenditure on a domestic item for use in the dwelling-house (\u201cthe new item\u201d), c the new item is provided solely for the use of the lessee, d the new item replaces the old item, and e following that replacement, the old item is no longer available for use in the dwelling-house. 4 Condition C is that a deduction for the expenditure is not prohibited by the wholly and exclusively rule but would otherwise be prohibited by the capital expenditure rule (see subsection (15)). 5 Condition D is that no allowance under CAA 2001 may be claimed in respect of the expenditure. 6 In calculating the profits of the business, a deduction for the expenditure is allowed. But this is subject to subsections (7) and (8). 7 No deduction is allowed for expenditure in a tax year if\u2014 a the business consists of or includes the commercial letting of furnished holiday accommodation (see Chapter 6), and b the dwelling-house constitutes some or all of that accommodation for the tax year. 8 No deduction is allowed for expenditure in a tax year if\u2014 a the person has rent-a-room receipts in respect of the dwelling-house for the tax year, and b section 793 or 797 (rent-a-room relief) applies in relation to those receipts. 9 The basic amount of the deduction is as follows\u2014 a where the new item is the same or substantially the same as the old item, the deduction is equal to the expenditure incurred by P on the new item; b where the new item is not the same or substantially the same as the old item, the deduction is equal to so much of the expenditure incurred by P on the new item as does not exceed the expenditure which P would have incurred on an item which is the same or substantially the same as the old item. Subsections (10) to (13) make further provision about the calculation of the deduction in certain cases. 10 If P incurs incidental expenditure of a capital nature in connection with the disposal of the old item or the purchase of the new item, the deduction is increased by the amount of the incidental expenditure. 11 If the old item is disposed of in part-exchange for the new item\u2014 a the expenditure incurred by P on the new item is treated as including an amount equal to the value of the old item, and b the deduction is reduced by that amount. 12 If the old item is disposed of other than in part-exchange for the new item, the deduction is reduced by the amount or value of any consideration in money or money's worth which P or a person connected with P receives, or is entitled to receive, in respect of the disposal. 13 For the purposes of subsection (12), where the old item is disposed of together with other consideration, the consideration in respect of the disposal mentioned in that subsection is taken not to include the amount of, or an amount equal to the value of, that other consideration. 14 In this section,  \u201c domestic item \u201d means an item for domestic use (such as furniture, furnishings, household appliances and kitchenware), and does not include anything that is a fixture. \u201cFixture\u201d\u2014 means any plant or machinery that is so installed or otherwise fixed in or to a dwelling-house as to become, in law, part of that dwelling-house, and includes any boiler or water-filled radiator installed in a dwelling-house as part of a space or water heating system. \u201cPlant or machinery\u201d here has the same meaning as in Part 2 of CAA 2001. 15 In this section\u2014 \u201c the capital expenditure rule \u201d means the rule in section 33 (capital expenditure), as applied by section 272; \u201c lessee \u201d means the person who is entitled to the use of the dwelling-house under a lease or other arrangement under which a sum is payable in respect of the use of the dwelling-house; \u201c the wholly and exclusively rule \u201d means the rule in section 34 (expenses not wholly and exclusively for trade and unconnected losses), as applied by section 272. 2 In Chapter 5 of Part 4 of CTA 2009 (property income), after section 250 insert\u2014 Deduction for replacement of domestic items Replacement domestic items relief 250A 1 This section applies if conditions A to D are met. 2 Condition A is that a company (\u201cC\u201d) carries on a property business in relation to land which consists of or includes a dwelling-house. 3 Condition B is that\u2014 a a domestic item has been provided for use in the dwelling-house (\u201cthe old item\u201d), b C incurs expenditure on a domestic item for use in the dwelling-house (\u201cthe new item\u201d), c the new item is provided solely for the use of the lessee, d the new item replaces the old item, and e following that replacement, the old item is no longer available for use in the dwelling-house. 4 Condition C is that a deduction for the expenditure is not prohibited by the wholly and exclusively rule but would otherwise be prohibited by the capital expenditure rule (see subsection (14)). 5 Condition D is that no allowance under CAA 2001 may be claimed in respect of the expenditure. 6 In calculating the profits of the business, a deduction for the expenditure is allowed. 7 But no deduction is allowed for expenditure in an accounting period if\u2014 a the business consists of or includes the commercial letting of furnished holiday accommodation (see Chapter 6), and b the dwelling-house constitutes some or all of that accommodation for the accounting period. 8 The basic amount of the deduction is as follows\u2014 a where the new item is the same or substantially the same as the old item, the deduction is equal to the expenditure incurred by C on the new item; b where the new item is not the same or substantially the same as the old item, the deduction is equal to so much of the expenditure incurred by C on the new item as does not exceed the expenditure which C would have incurred on an item which is the same or substantially the same as the old item.

old item or the purchase of the new item, the deduction is increased by the amount of the incidental expenditure. 10 If the old item is disposed of in part-exchange for the new item\u2014 a the expenditure incurred by C on the new item is treated as including an amount equal to the value of the old item, and b the deduction is reduced by that amount. 11 If the old item is disposed of other than in part-exchange for the new item, the deduction is reduced by the amount or value of any consideration in money or money's worth which C or a person connected with C receives, or is entitled to receive, in respect of the disposal. 12 For the purposes of subsection (11), where the old item is disposed of together with other consideration, the consideration in respect of the disposal mentioned in that subsection is taken not to include the amount of, or an amount equal to the value of, that other consideration. 13 In this section,  \u201c domestic item \u201d means an item for domestic use

Amounts treated as profits of a trade Disposals of land in the United Kingdom 356OB 1 Section 356OC(1) applies (subject to subsection (3) of that section) if\u2014 a a person within subsection (2)(a), (b) or (c) realises a profit or gain from a disposal of any land in the United Kingdom, and b any of conditions A to D is met in relation to the land. 2 The persons referred to in subsection (1) are\u2014 a the person acquiring, holding or developing the land, b a person who is associated with the person in paragraph (a) at a relevant time, and c a person who is a party to, or concerned in, an arrangement within subsection (3). 3 An arrangement is within this subsection if\u2014 a it is effected with respect to all or part of the land, and b it enables a profit or gain to be realised\u2014 i by any indirect method, or ii by any series of transactions. 4 Condition A is that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of acquiring the land was to realise a profit or gain from disposing of the land. 5 Condition B is that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of acquiring any property deriving its value from the land was to realise a profit or gain from disposing of the land. 6 Condition C is that the land is held as trading stock. 7 Condition D is that (in a case where the land has been developed) the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of developing the land was to realise a profit or gain from disposing of the land when developed. 8 In this section  \u201c relevant time \u201d means any time in the period beginning when the activities of the project begin and ending 6 months after the disposal mentioned in subsection (1). 9 In this section  \u201c the project \u201d means all activities carried out for any of the following purposes\u2014 a the purposes of dealing in or developing the land, and b any other purposes mentioned in Conditions A to D. 10 For the purposes of this section a person (\u201cA\u201d) is associated with another person (\u201cB\u201d) if\u2014 a A is connected with B by virtue of any of subsections (5) to (7) of section 1122 (read in accordance with section 1123), or b A is related to B (see section 356OT). Disposals of land: profits treated as trading profits 356OC 1 The profit or gain is to be treated for corporation tax purposes as profits of a trade carried on by the chargeable company (see section 356OG). 2 If the chargeable company is non-UK resident, that trade is the company's trade of dealing in or developing UK land (as defined in section 5B of CTA 2009). 3 But subsection (1) does not apply to a profit or gain so far as it would (apart from this section) be brought into account as income in calculating profits (of any person)\u2014 a for corporation tax purposes, or b for income tax purposes. 4 The profits are treated as arising in the accounting period of the chargeable company in which the profit or gain is realised. 5 This section applies in relation to gains which are capital in nature as it applies in relation to other gains. Disposals of property deriving its value from land in the United Kingdom 356OD 1 Section 356OE applies (subject to subsection (3) of that section) if\u2014 a a person realises a profit or gain from a disposal of any property which (at the time of the disposal) derives at least 50% of its value from land in the United Kingdom, b the person is a party to, or concerned in, an arrangement concerning some or all of the land mentioned in paragraph (a) (\u201cthe project land\u201d), and c the arrangement meets the condition in subsection (2). 2 The condition is that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the arrangement is to\u2014 a deal in or develop the project land, and b realise a profit or gain from a disposal of property deriving the whole or part of its value from that land. Disposals within section 356OD: profits treated as trading profits 356OE 1 The relevant amount is to be treated for corporation tax purposes as profits of a trade carried on by the chargeable company. 2 If the chargeable company is non-UK resident, that trade is the company's trade of dealing in or developing UK land. 3 But subsection (1) does not apply to an amount so far as it would (apart from this section) be brought into account as income in calculating profits (of any person)\u2014 a for corporation tax purposes, or b for income tax purposes. 4 The profits are treated as arising in the accounting period of the chargeable company in which the profit or gain is realised. 5 In this section the  \u201c relevant amount \u201d means so much (if any) of the profit or gain mentioned in section 356OD(1) as is attributable, on a just and reasonable apportionment, to the relevant UK assets. 6 In this section  \u201c the relevant UK assets \u201d means any land in the United Kingdom from which the property mentioned in section 356OD(1) derives any of its value (at the time of the disposal mentioned in that subsection). 7 This section applies in relation to gains which are capital in nature as it applies in relation to other gains. Profits and losses 356OF 1 Sections 356OB to 356OE have effect as if they included provision about losses corresponding to the provision they make about profits and gains. 2 Accordingly, in the following sections of this Part references to a  \u201cprofit or gain\u201d include a loss. Person to whom profits attributed The chargeable company 356OG 1 For the purposes of sections 356OC and 356OE the general rule is that the  \u201cchargeable company\u201d is the company (\u201cC\u201d) that realises the profit or gain (as mentioned in section 356OB(1) or 356OD(1)). 2 The general rule in subsection (1) is subject to the special rules in subsections (4) to (6). 3 But those special rules do not apply in relation to a profit or gain to which section 356OH(3) (fragmented activities) applies. 4 If all or any part of the profit or gain accruing to C is derived from value provided directly or indirectly by another person (\u201cB\u201d) which is a company, B is the  \u201cchargeable company\u201d. 5 Subsection (4) applies whether or not the value is put at the disposal of C. 6 If all or any part of the profit or gain accruing to C is derived from an opportunity of realising a profit or gain provided directly or indirectly by another person (\u201cD\u201d) which is a company, D is  \u201cthe chargeable company\u201d (unless the case falls within subsection (4)). 7 For the meaning of  \u201canother person\u201d see section 356OO. Anti-fragmentation Fragmented activities 356OH 1 Subsection (3) applies if\u2014 a a company (\u201cC\u201d) disposes of any land in the United Kingdom, b any of conditions A to D in section 356OB is met in relation to the land, and c a person (\u201cR\u201d) who is associated with C at a relevant time has made a relevant contribution to activities falling within subsection (2). 2 The following activities fall within this subsection\u2014 a the development of the land, b any other activities directed towards realising a profit or gain from the disposal of the land. 3 For the purposes of this Part, the profit or gain (if any) realised by C from the disposal is to be taken to be what that profit or gain would be if R were not a distinct person from C (and, accordingly, as if everything done by or in relation to R had been done by or in relation to C). 4 Subsection (5) applies to any amount which is paid (directly or indirectly) by R to C for the purposes of meeting or reimbursing the cost of corporation tax which C is liable to pay as a result of the application of subsection (3) in relation to R and C. 5 The amount\u2014 a is not to be taken into account in calculating profits or losses of either R or C for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax, and b is not for any purpose of the Corporation Tax Acts to be regarded as a distribution. 6 In subsection (1)  \u201c relevant time \u201d means any time in the period beginning when the activities of the project begin and ending 6 months after the disposal. 7 For the purposes of this section any contribution made by R to activities falling within subsection (2) is a  \u201crelevant contribution\u201d unless the profit made or to be made by R in respect of the contribution is insignificant having regard to the size of the project. 8 In this section  \u201c contribution \u201d means any kind of contribution, including, for example\u2014 a the provision of professional or other services, or b a financial contribution (including the assumption of a risk). 9 For the purposes of this section R is  \u201cassociated\u201d with C if\u2014 a R is connected with C by virtue of any of subsections (5) to (7) of section 1122 (read in accordance with section 1123), or b R is related to C (see section 356OT). 10 In this section  \u201c the project \u201d means all activities carried out for any of the following purposes\u2014 a the purposes of dealing in or developing the land, and b any other purposes mentioned in Conditions A to D in section 356OB. Calculation of profit or gain on disposal Calculation of profit or gain on disposal 356OI For the purposes of this Part, the profit or gain (if any) from a disposal of any property is to be calculated according to the principles applicable for calculating the profits of a trade under Part 3 of CTA 2009, subject to any modifications that may be appropriate (and for this purpose the same rules are to apply in calculating losses from a disposal as apply in calculating profits). Apportionments 356OJ Any apportionment (whether of expenditure, consideration or any other amount) that is required to be made for the purposes of this Part is to be made on a just and reasonable basis. Arrangements for avoiding tax Arrangements for avoiding tax 356OK 1 Subsection (3) applies if an arrangement has been entered into the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to enable a company to obtain a relevant tax advantage. 2 In subsection (1) the reference to obtaining a relevant tax advantage includes obtaining a relevant tax advantage by virtue of any provisions of double taxation arrangements, but only in a case where the relevant tax advantage is contrary to the object and purpose of the provisions of the double taxation arrangements (and subsection (3) has effect accordingly, regardless of anything in section 6(1) of TIOPA 2010). 3 The tax advantage is to be counteracted by means of adjustments. 4 For this purpose adjustments may be made (whether by an officer of Revenue and Customs or by the company) by way of an assessment, the modification of an assessment, amendment or disallowance of a claim, or otherwise. 5 In this section  \u201c relevant tax advantage \u201d means a tax advantage in relation to corporation tax charged (or which would, if the tax advantage were not obtained, be charged) in respect of amounts treated as profits of a trade by virtue of this Part. 6 In this section\u2014 \u201c double taxation arrangements \u201d means arrangements which have effect under section 2(1) of TIOPA 2010 (double taxation relief by agreement with territories outside the United Kingdom); \u201c tax advantage \u201d has the meaning given by section 1139. Exemption Profits attributable to period before relevant activities etc began 356OL 1 Subsection (2) applies if\u2014 a subsection (1) of section 356OC applies because Condition D in section 356OB is met (land developed with purpose of realising a gain from its disposal when developed), and b part of the profit or gain mentioned in that subsection is fairly attributable to a period before the intention to develop was formed. 2 Section 356OC(1) has effect as if the person mentioned in section 356OB(1) had not realised that part of the profit or gain. 3 Subsection (4) applies if\u2014 a section 356OE(1) applies, and b part of the profit or gain mentioned in section 356OE(5) is fairly attributable to a period before the person mentioned in section 356OD(1) was a party to, or concerned in, the arrangement in question. 4 Section 356OE has effect as if the person had not realised that part of the profit or gain. 5 In applying this section account must be taken of the treatment under Part 3 of CTA 2009 (trading income) of a company which appropriates land as trading stock. Other supplementary provisions Tracing value 356OM 1 This section applies if it is necessary to determine the extent to which the value of any property or right is derived from any other property or right for the purposes of this Part. 2 Value may be traced through any number of companies, partnerships, trusts and other entities or arrangements. 3 The property held by a company, partnership or trust must be attributed to the shareholders, partners, beneficiaries or other participants at each stage in whatever way is appropriate in the circumstances. 4 In this section\u2014 \u201c partnership \u201d includes an entity established under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom of a similar nature to a partnership; and  \u201c partners \u201d, in relation to such arrangements, is to be construed accordingly; \u201c trust \u201d includes arrangements\u2014 which have effect under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom; and under which persons acting in a fiduciary capacity hold and administer property on behalf of other persons, and  \u201c beneficiaries \u201d, in relation to such arrangements, is to be construed accordingly. Relevance of transactions, arrangements, etc 356ON 1 In determining whether section 356OC(1) or 356OE(1) applies, account is to be taken of any method, however indirect, by which\u2014 a any property or right is transferred or transmitted, or b the value of any property or right is enhanced or diminished. 2 Accordingly\u2014 a the occasion of the transfer or transmission of any property or right, however indirect, and b the occasion when the value of any property or right is enhanced, may be an occasion on which section 356OC(1) or 356OE(1) applies. 3 Subsections (1) and (2) apply in particular\u2014 a to sales, contracts and other transactions made otherwise than for full consideration or for more than full consideration, b to any method by which any property or right, or the control of any property or right, is transferred or transmitted by assigning\u2014 i share capital or other rights in a company, ii rights in a partnership, or iii an interest in settled property, c to the creation of an option affecting the disposition of any property or right and the giving of consideration for granting it, d to the creation of a requirement for consent affecting such a disposition and the giving of consideration for granting it, e to the creation of an embargo affecting such a disposition and the giving of consideration for releasing it, and f to the disposal of any property or right on the winding up, dissolution or termination of a company, partnership or trust.

Amounts treated as profits of a trade Disposals of land in the United Kingdom 517B 1 Section 517C(1) applies (subject to subsection (3) of that section) if\u2014 a a person within subsection (2)(a), (b) or (c) realises a profit or gain from a disposal of any land in the United Kingdom, and b any of conditions A to D is met in relation to the land. 2 The persons referred to in subsection (1) are\u2014 a the person acquiring, holding or developing the land, b a person who is associated with the person in paragraph (a) at a relevant time, and c a person who is a party to, or concerned in, an arrangement within subsection (3). 3 An arrangement is within this subsection if\u2014 a it is effected with respect to all or part of the land, and b it enables a profit or gain to be realised\u2014 i by any indirect method, or ii by any series of transactions. 4 Condition A is that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of acquiring the land was to realise a profit or gain from disposing of the land. 5 Condition B is that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of acquiring any property deriving its value from the land was to realise a profit or gain from disposing of the land. 6 Condition C is that the land is held as trading stock. 7 Condition D is that (in a case where the land has been developed) the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of developing the land was to realise a profit or gain from disposing of the land when developed. 8 In this section  \u201c relevant time \u201d means any time in the period beginning when the activities of the project begin and ending 6 months after the disposal mentioned in subsection (1). 9 In this section  \u201c the project \u201d means all activities carried out for any of the following purposes\u2014 a the purposes of dealing in or developing the land, and b any other purposes mentioned in Conditions A to D. 10 For the purposes of this section a person (\u201cA\u201d) is associated with another person (\u201cB\u201d) if\u2014 a A is connected with B by virtue of any of subsections (2) to (4) of section 993 (read in accordance with section 994), or b A is related to B (see section 517U). Disposals of land: profits treated as trading profits 517C 1 The profit or gain is to be treated for income tax purposes as profits of a trade carried on by the chargeable person. 2 If the chargeable person is non-UK resident, that trade is the person's trade of dealing in or developing UK land (as defined in section 6B of ITTOIA 2005). 3 But subsection (1) does not apply to a profit or gain so far as it would (apart from this section) be brought into account as income in calculating profits (of any person)\u2014 a for income tax purposes, or b for corporation tax purposes. 4 The profits are treated as arising in the tax year in which the profit or gain is realised. 5 This section applies in relation to gains which are capital in nature as it applies in relation to other gains. Disposals of property deriving its value from land in the United Kingdom 517D 1 Section 517E(1) applies (subject to subsection (3) of that section) if\u2014 a a person realises a profit or gain from a disposal of any property which (at the time of the disposal) derives at least 50% of its value from land in the United Kingdom, b the person is a party to, or concerned in, an arrangement concerning some or all of the land mentioned in paragraph (a) (\u201cthe project land\u201d), and c the arrangement meets the condition in subsection (2). 2 The condition is that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the arrangement is to\u2014 a deal in or develop the project land, and b realise a profit or gain from a disposal of property deriving the whole or part of its value from that land. Disposals within section 517D: profits treated as trading profits 517E 1 The relevant amount is to be treated for income tax purposes as profits of a trade carried on by the chargeable person. 2 If the chargeable person is non-UK resident, that trade is the chargeable person's trade of dealing in or developing UK land. 3 But subsection (1) does not apply to an amount so far as it would (apart from this section) be brought into account as income in calculating profits (of any person)\u2014 a for income tax purposes, or b for corporation tax purposes. 4 The profits are treated as arising in the tax year in which the profit or gain is realised. 5 In this section the  \u201c relevant amount \u201d means so much (if any) of the profit or gain mentioned in section 517D(1) as is attributable, on a just and reasonable apportionment, to the relevant UK assets. 6 In this section  \u201c the relevant UK assets \u201d means any land in the United Kingdom from which the property mentioned in section 517D(1) derives any of its value (at the time of the disposal mentioned in that subsection). 7 This section applies in relation to gains which are capital in nature as it applies in relation to other gains. Profits and losses 517F 1 Sections 517B to 517E have effect as if they included provision about losses corresponding to the provision they make about profits and gains. 2 Accordingly, in the following sections of this Part references to a  \u201cprofit or gain\u201d include a loss. Person to whom profits attributed The chargeable person 517G 1 For the purposes of sections 517C and 517E the general rule is that the  \u201cchargeable person\u201d is the person (\u201cP\u201d) that realises the profit or gain (as mentioned in section 517B(1) or 517D(1)). 2 The general rule in subsection (1) is subject to the special rules in subsections (4) to (6). 3 But those special rules do not apply in relation to a profit or gain to which section 517H(3) (fragmented activities) applies. 4 If all or any part of the profit or gain accruing to P is derived from value provided directly or indirectly by another person (\u201cB\u201d), B is the  \u201cchargeable person\u201d. 5 Subsection (4) applies whether or not the value is put at the disposal of P. 6 If all or any part of the profit or gain accruing to P is derived from an opportunity of realising a profit or gain provided directly or indirectly by another person (\u201cD\u201d), D is  \u201cthe chargeable person\u201d (unless the case falls within subsection (4)). 7 For the meaning of  \u201canother person\u201d see section 517P. Anti-fragmentation Fragmented activities 517H 1 Subsection (3) applies if\u2014 a a person (\u201cP\u201d) disposes of any land in the United Kingdom, b any of conditions A to D in section 517B is met in relation to the land, and c a person (\u201cR\u201d) who is associated with P at a relevant time has made a relevant contribution to activities falling within subsection (2). 2 The following activities fall within this subsection\u2014 a the development of the land, b any other activities directed towards realising a profit or gain from the disposal of the land. 3 For the purposes of this Part, the profit or gain (if any) realised by P from the disposal is to be taken to be what that profit or gain would be if R were not a distinct person from P (and, accordingly, as if everything done by or in relation to R had been done by or in relation to P). 4 Subsection (5) applies to any amount which is paid (directly or indirectly) by R to P for the purposes of meeting or reimbursing the cost of income tax which P is liable to pay as a result of the application of subsection (3) in relation to R and P. 5 The amount\u2014 a is not to be taken into account in calculating profits or losses of either R or P for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax, and b is not for any purpose of the Corporation Tax Acts to be regarded as a distribution. 6 In subsection (1)  \u201c relevant time \u201d means any time in the period beginning when the activities of the project begin and ending 6 months after the disposal. 7 For the purposes of this section any contribution made by P to activities falling within subsection (2) is a  \u201crelevant contribution\u201d unless the profit made or to be made by P in respect of the contribution is insignificant having regard to the size of the project. 8 In this section  \u201c contribution \u201d means any kind of contribution, including, for example\u2014 a the provision of professional or other services, or b a financial contribution (including the assumption of a risk). 9 For the purposes of this section R is  \u201cassociated\u201d with P if\u2014 a R is connected with P by virtue of any of subsections (2) to (4) of section 993 (read in accordance with section 994), or b R is related to P (see section 517U). 10 In this section  \u201c the project \u201d means all activities carried out for any of the following purposes\u2014 a the purposes of dealing in or developing the land, and b any other purposes mentioned in Conditions A to D in section 517B. Calculation of profit or gain on disposal Calculation of surplus on a disposal of land 517I For the purposes of this Part, the profit or gain (if any) from a disposal of any property is to be calculated according to the principles applicable for calculating the profits of a trade under Part 2 of ITTOIA 2005, subject to any modifications that may be appropriate (and for this purpose the same rules are to apply in calculating losses from a disposal as apply in calculating profits). Apportionments 517J Any apportionment (whether of expenditure, consideration or any other amount) that is required to be made for the purposes of this Part is to be made on a just and reasonable basis. Arrangements for avoiding tax Arrangements for avoiding tax 517K 1 Subsection (3) applies if an arrangement has been entered into the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to enable a person to obtain a relevant tax advantage. 2 In subsection (1) the reference to obtaining a relevant tax advantage includes obtaining a relevant tax advantage by virtue of any provisions of double taxation arrangements, but only in a case where the relevant tax advantage is contrary to the object and purpose of the provisions of the double taxation arrangements (and subsection (3) has effect accordingly, regardless of anything in section 6(1) of TIOPA 2010). 3 The tax advantage is to be counteracted by means of adjustments. 4 For this purpose adjustments may be made (whether by an officer of Revenue and Customs or by the person) by way of an assessment, the modification of an assessment, amendment or disallowance of a claim, or otherwise. 5 In this section  \u201c relevant tax advantage \u201d means an advantage in relation to income tax charged (or which would, if the tax advantage were not obtained, be charged) in respect of amounts treated as profits of a trade by virtue of this Part. 6 In this section  \u201c advantage \u201d includes\u2014 a a relief or increased relief from tax, b repayment or increased repayment of tax, c avoidance or reduction of a charge to tax or an assessment to tax, d avoidance of a possible assessment to tax, e deferral of a payment of tax or advancement of a repayment of tax, and f avoidance of an obligation to deduct or account for tax. Exemptions Gain attributable to period before intention to develop formed 517L 1 Subsection (2) applies if\u2014 a subsection (1) of section 517C applies because Condition D in section 517B is met (land developed with purpose of realising a gain from its disposal when developed), and b part of the profit or gain mentioned in that subsection is fairly attributable to a period before the intention to develop was formed. 2 Section 517C(1) has effect as if the person mentioned in section 517B(1) had not realised that part of the profit or gain. 3 Subsection (4) applies if\u2014 a section 517E(1) applies, and b part of the profit or gain mentioned in section 517E(5) is fairly attributable to a period before the person mentioned in section 517D(1) was a party to, or concerned in, the arrangement in question. 4 Section 517E has effect as if the person had not realised that part of the profit or gain. 5 In applying this section account must be taken of the treatment under Part 2 of ITTOIA 2005 (trading income) of a person who appropriates land as trading stock. Private residences 517M No liability to income tax arises under this Part in respect of a gain accruing to an individual if\u2014 a the gain is exempt from capital gains tax as a result of sections 222 to 226 of TCGA 1992 (private residences), or b it would be so exempt but for section 224(3) of that Act (residences acquired partly with a view to making a gain). Other supplementary provisions Tracing value 517N 1 This section applies if it is necessary to determine the extent to which the value of any property or right is derived from any other property or right for the purposes of this Part. 2 Value may be traced through any number of companies, partnerships, trusts and other entities or arrangements. 3 The property held by a company, partnership or trust must be attributed to the shareholders, partners, beneficiaries or other participants at each stage in whatever way is appropriate in the circumstances. 4 In this section\u2014 \u201c partnership \u201d includes an entity established under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom of a similar nature to a partnership; and  \u201c partners \u201d, in relation to such arrangements, is to be construed accordingly; \u201c trust \u201d includes arrangements\u2014 which have effect under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom; and under which persons acting in a fiduciary capacity hold and administer property on behalf of other persons, and  \u201c beneficiaries \u201d, in relation to such arrangements, is to be construed accordingly. Relevance of transactions, arrangements, etc 517O 1 In determining whether section 517C(1) or 517E(1) applies, account is to be taken of any method, however indirect, by which\u2014 a any property or right is transferred or transmitted, or b the value of any property or right is enhanced or diminished. 2 Accordingly\u2014 a the occasion of the transfer or transmission of any property or right, however indirect, and b the occasion when the value of any property or right is enhanced, may be an occasion on which section 517C(1) or 517E(1) applies. 3 Subsections (1) and (2) apply in particular\u2014 a to sales, contracts and other transactions made otherwise than for full consideration or for more than full consideration, b to any method by which any property or right, or the control of any property or right, is transferred or transmitted by assigning\u2014 i share capital or other rights in a company, ii rights in a partnership, or iii an interest in settled property, c to the creation of an option affecting the disposition of any property or right and the giving of consideration for granting it, d to the creation of a requirement for consent affecting such a disposition and the giving of consideration for granting it, e to the creation of an embargo affecting such a disposition and the giving of consideration for releasing it, and f to the disposal of any property or right on the winding up, dissolution or termination of a company, partnership or trust. Interpretation \u201cAnother person\u201d 517P 1 In this Part references to  \u201cother\u201d persons are to be interpreted in accordance with subsections (2) to (4). 2 A partnership or partners in a partnership may be regarded as a person or persons distinct from the individuals or other persons who are for the time being partners. 3 The trustees of settled property may be regarded as persons distinct from the individuals or other persons who are for the time being the trustees. 4 Personal representatives may be regarded as persons distinct from the individuals or other persons who are for the time being personal representatives. \u201cArrangement\u201d 517Q 1 In this Part  \u201carrangement\u201d (except in the phrase  \u201cdouble taxation arrangements\u201d) includes any agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions, whether or not legally enforceable. 2 For the purposes of this Part any number of transactions may be regarded as constituting a single arrangement if\u2014 a a common purpose can be discerned in them, or b there is other sufficient evidence of a common purpose. \u201cDisposal\u201d 517R 1 In this Part references to a  \u201cdisposal\u201d of any property include any case in which the property is effectively disposed of (whether wholly or in part, as mentioned in subsection (2))\u2014 a by one or more transactions, or b by any arrangement. 2 For the purposes of this Part\u2014 a references to a disposal of land or any other property include a part disposal of the property, and b there is a part disposal of property (\u201c the asset \u201d) where on a person making a disposal, any form of property derived from the asset remains undisposed of (including in cases where an interest or right in or over the asset is created by the disposal, as well as where it subsists before the disposal). \u201cLand\u201d and related expressions 517S 1 In this Part  \u201c land \u201d includes\u2014 a buildings and structures, b any estate, interest or right in or over land, and c land under the sea or otherwise covered by water. 2 In this Part references to property deriving its value from land include\u2014 a any shareholding in a company deriving its value directly or indirectly from land, b any partnership interest deriving its value directly or indirectly from land, c any interest in settled property deriving its value directly or indirectly from land, and d any option, consent or embargo affecting the disposition of land. References to realising a gain 517T 1 For the purposes of sections 517B(1) and 517D(1) it does not matter whether the person (\u201cP\u201d) realising the profit or gain in question realises it for P or another person. 2 For the purposes of subsection (1), if, for example by a premature sale, a person (\u201cA\u201d) directly or indirectly transmits the opportunity of realising a profit or gain to another person (\u201cB\u201d), A realises B's profit or gain for B. Related parties 517U 1 For the purposes of this Part a person (\u201cA\u201d) is related to another person (\u201cB\u201d)\u2014 a throughout any period for which A and B are consolidated for

participates in the management, control or capital of the other, or b the same person or persons directly or indirectly participate in the management, control or capital of each of the relevant parties. 5 The 25% investment condition is met in relation to A and B if\u2014 a one of them has a 25% investment in the other, or b a third person has a 25% investment in each of them. 6 Section 259NC of TIOPA 2010 applies for the purposes of determining whether a person has a  \u201c25% investment\u201d in another person for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of section 259NB(2) of that Act. 7 In Chapter 2 of Part 4 of TIOPA 2010, sections 157(2), 158(4), 159(2) and 160(2) (which are about the interpretation of references to direct and indirect participation)

disposal\u201d), subsection (1) applies only to so much of the gain as, when added to the total amount of previous potentially chargeable gains, does not exceed \u00a3100,000. 1B For the purposes of subsection (1A),  \u201c previous potentially chargeable gain \u201d means a gain accruing to P on the first disposal of a post-16 March 2016 exempt employee shareholder share at any time before the relevant disposal. 1C Where a single transaction disposes of more than one post-16 March 2016 exempt employee shareholder share, the reference in subsection (1A) to the first disposal of a share is to be treated as a reference to the disposal of all of the post-16 March 2016 exempt employee shareholder shares first disposed of by that transaction. 3 After subsection (3) insert\u2014 3A In this section,  \u201c post-16 March 2016 exempt employee shareholder share \u201d means an exempt employee shareholder share acquired in consideration of an employee shareholder agreement entered into after 16 March 2016. 4 Section 236F of TCGA 1992 (reorganisation of share capital involving employee shareholder shares) is amended in accordance with subsections (5) and (6). 5 After subsection (1) insert\u2014 1A Subsection (1B) applies where\u2014 a an exempt employee shareholder share (\u201cthe original EES share\u201d) is held by a person (\u201cP\u201d) before, and is concerned in, a reorganisation, and b the original EES share is disposed of on the reorganisation. 1B P is to be treated as if the original EES share were disposed of for consideration of an amount determined in accordance with subsections (1D) to (1H) (the  \u201crelevant amount\u201d). 1C In this section  \u201c notional gain \u201d means the gain, if any, that would accrue to P if the original EES share were disposed of on the reorganisation for consideration of an amount equal to the market value of the share. 1D Subsections (1E) to (1G) apply where a notional gain would accrue to P on the disposal of the original EES share. 1E Where the whole of the notional gain would be a chargeable gain by virtue of section 236B(1A), the relevant amount is the amount that would secure that on the disposal neither a gain nor a loss would accrue to P. 1F Where part (but not the whole) of the notional gain would be a chargeable gain by virtue of section 236B(1A), the relevant amount is the maximum amount, not exceeding the market value of the share, that would secure that on the disposal no chargeable gain would accrue to P. 1G Where no part of the notional gain would be a chargeable gain by virtue of section 236B(1A), the relevant amount is equal to the market value of the original EES share at the time of the disposal. 1H Where no notional gain would accrue to P on the disposal of the original EES share, the relevant amount is the amount that would secure that on the disposal neither a gain nor a loss would accrue to P. 1I In determining for the purposes of this section whether any part of a notional gain is a chargeable gain by virtue of section 236B(1A), subsection (1B) is to be disregarded. 1J Where more than one original EES share is disposed of by P on a reorganisation, references in this section to the disposal of the original EES share are to be treated as references to the disposal of all of the original EES shares disposed of on the reorganisation. 1K In this section

(2) a disposal of exempt employee shareholder shares is a  \u201crelevant disposal\u201d if (apart from this section)\u2014 a a gain would accrue on the disposal, and b no part of the gain would be a chargeable gain. 4 Subsection (5) applies where the disposal is of exempt employee shareholder shares and (apart from this section)\u2014 a a gain would accrue on the disposal, and b part (but not the whole) of the gain would be a chargeable gain by virtue of section 236B(1A). 5 Where this subsection applies, subsection (1) has effect in relation to the disposal as if\u2014 a for  \u201csuch amount

PART 3 Supplementary provisions Further provision in connection with paragraph 3(6) and (7) 8 1 This paragraph applies where by reason of paragraph 3(7) a chargeable transaction (\u201cthe transaction concerned\u201d) ceases to be a higher rates transaction for the purposes of paragraph 1. 2 The land transaction (\u201cthe subsequent transaction\u201d) by reference to which the condition in paragraph 3(7)(b) was met may not be taken into account for the purposes of paragraph 3(6)(b) in determining whether any other chargeable transaction is a higher rates transaction. 3 A land transaction return in respect of the transaction concerned may be amended, to take account of its ceasing to be a higher rates transaction, at any time within whichever of the following periods expires later\u2014 a the period of 3 months beginning within the effective date of the subsequent transaction, and b the period of 12 months beginning with the filing date for the return. 4 Where a land transaction return in respect of the transaction concerned is amended to take account of its ceasing to be a higher rates transaction (and not for any other reason), paragraph 6(2A) of Schedule 10 (notice of amendment of return to be accompanied by the contract for the transaction etc) does not apply in relation to the amendment. Spouses and civil partners purchasing alone 9 1 Sub-paragraph (2) applies in relation to a chargeable transaction if\u2014 a the purchaser (or one of them) is married or in a civil partnership on the effective date, b the purchaser and the purchaser's spouse or civil partner are living together on that date, and c the purchaser's spouse or civil partner is not a purchaser in relation to the transaction. 2 The transaction is to be treated as being a higher rates transaction for the purposes of paragraph 1 if it would have been a higher rates transaction had the purchaser's spouse or civil partner been a purchaser. 3 Persons who are married to, or are civil partners of, each other are treated as living together for the purposes of this paragraph if they are so treated for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts (see section 1011 of the Income Tax Act 2007). Settlements and bare trusts 10 1 Sub-paragraph (3) applies in relation to a land transaction if\u2014 a the main subject-matter of the transaction consists of a major interest in one or more dwellings, b the purchaser (or one of them) is acting as trustee of a settlement, and c under the terms of the settlement a beneficiary will be entitled to\u2014 i occupy the dwelling or dwellings for life, or ii income earned in respect of the dwelling or dwellings. 2 Sub-paragraph (3) also applies in relation to a land transaction if\u2014 a the main subject-matter of the transaction consists of a term of years absolute in a dwelling, and b the purchaser (or one of them) is acting as a trustee of a bare trust. 3 Where this sub-paragraph applies in relation to a land transaction the beneficiary of the settlement or bare trust (rather than the trustee) is to be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as the purchaser (or as one of them). 4 Paragraphs 3(3) and 4 of Schedule 16 (trustees to be treated as the purchaser) have effect subject to sub-paragraph (3). 11 1 Sub-paragraph (3) applies where\u2014 a a person is a beneficiary under a settlement, b a major interest in a dwelling forms part of the trust property, and c under the terms of the settlement, the beneficiary is entitled to\u2014 i occupy the dwelling for life, or ii income earned in respect of the dwelling. 2 Sub-paragraph (3) also applies where\u2014 a a person is a beneficiary under a bare trust, and b a term of years absolute in a dwelling forms part of the trust property. 3 Where this sub-paragraph applies\u2014 a the beneficiary is to be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as holding the interest in the dwelling, and b if the trustee of the settlement or bare trust disposes of the interest, the beneficiary is to be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as having disposed of it. 12 1 This paragraph applies where, by reason of paragraph 10 or 11 or paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 16, the child of a person (\u201cP\u201d) would (but for this paragraph) be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as\u2014 a being the purchaser in relation to a land transaction, b holding an interest in a dwelling, or c having disposed of an interest in a dwelling. 2 Where this paragraph applies\u2014 a P and any spouse or civil partner of P are to be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as being the purchaser, holding the interest or (as the case may be) having disposed of the interest, and b the child is not to be so treated. 3 But sub-paragraph (2)(a) does not apply in relation to a spouse or civil partner of P if the two of them are not living together. 4 Sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 9 applies for the purposes of this paragraph as it applies for the purposes of that paragraph. 5 \u201c Child \u201d means a person under the age of 18. 13 1 This paragraph applies in relation to a land transaction if\u2014 a the main subject-matter of the transaction consists of a major interest in one or more dwellings, b the purchaser (or one of them) is acting as trustee of a settlement, c that purchaser is an individual, and d under the terms of the settlement a beneficiary is not entitled to\u2014 i occupy the dwelling or dwellings for life, or ii income earned in respect of the dwelling or dwellings. 2 In determining whether the transaction falls within paragraph 4 or paragraph 7\u2014 a if the purchaser mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) is the only purchaser, ignore paragraph (a) of those paragraphs, and b if that purchaser is not the only purchaser, ignore paragraph (a) of those paragraphs when having regard to that purchaser. Partnerships 14 1 Sub-paragraph (2) applies in relation to a chargeable transaction whose subject-matter consists of a major interest in one or more dwellings if\u2014 a the purchaser (or one of them) is a partner in a partnership, but b the purchaser does not enter into the transaction for the purposes of the partnership. 2 For the purposes of determining whether the transaction falls within paragraph 3 or 6 any major interest in any other dwelling that is held by or on behalf of the partnership for the purposes of a trade carried on by the partnership is not to be treated as held by or on behalf of the purchaser. 3 Paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 15 (chargeable interests held by partnerships treated as held by the partners) has effect subject to sub-paragraph (2). Alternative finance arrangements 15 1 This paragraph applies in relation to a chargeable transaction which is the first transaction under an alternative finance arrangement entered into between a person and a financial institution. 2 The person (rather than the institution) is to be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as the purchaser in relation to the transaction. 3 In this paragraph\u2014 \u201c alternative finance arrangement \u201d means an arrangement of a kind mentioned in section 71A(1) or 73(1); \u201c financial institution \u201d has the meaning it has in those sections (see section 73BA); \u201c first transaction \u201d, in relation to an alternative finance arrangement, has the meaning given by section 71A(1)(a) or (as the case may be) section 73(1)(a)(i). Major interests in dwellings inherited jointly 16 1 This paragraph applies where by virtue of an inheritance\u2014 a a person (\u201cP\u201d) becomes jointly entitled with one or more other persons to a major interest in a dwelling, and b P's beneficial share in the interest does not exceed 50% (see sub-paragraph (4)). 2 P is not to be treated for the purposes of paragraph 3(4)(a) or 6(1)(e) as having the major interest at any time during the period of three years beginning with the date of the inheritance. 3 But if at any time during that period of three years P becomes the only person beneficially entitled to the whole of the interest or P's beneficial share in the interest exceeds 50% P is, from that time, to be treated as having the major interest for the purposes of paragraph 3(4)(a) and 6(1)(e) (subject to any disposal by P). 4 P's share in the interest exceeds 50% if\u2014 a P is beneficially entitled as a tenant in common or coparcener to more than half the interest, b P and P's spouse or civil partner taken together are beneficially entitled as tenants in common or coparceners to more than half the interest, or c P and P's spouse or civil partner are beneficially entitled as joint tenants to the interest and there is no more than one other joint tenant who is so entitled. 5 In this section  \u201c inheritance \u201d means the acquisition of an interest in or towards satisfaction of an entitlement under or in relation to the will of a deceased person, or on the intestacy of a deceased person. Dwellings outside England, Wales and Northern Ireland 17 1 In the provisions of this Schedule specified in sub-paragraph (3), references to a  \u201cdwelling\u201d include references to a dwelling situated in a country or territory outside England, Wales and Northern Ireland. 2 In the application of those provisions in relation to a dwelling situated in a country or territory outside England, Wales and Northern Ireland\u2014 a references to a  \u201cmajor interest\u201d in the dwelling are to an equivalent interest in the dwelling under the law of that country or territory, b references to persons being beneficially entitled as joint tenants, tenants in common or coparceners to an interest in the dwelling are to persons having an equivalent entitlement to the interest in the dwelling under the law of that country or territory, c references to a  \u201c land transaction \u201d in relation to the dwelling are to the acquisition of an interest in the dwelling under the law of that country or territory, d references to the  \u201c effective date \u201d of a land transaction in relation to the dwelling are to the date on which the interest in the dwelling is acquired under the law of that country or territory, e references to  \u201cinheritance\u201d are to the acquisition of an interest from a deceased person's estate in accordance with the laws of that country or territory concerning the inheritance of property. 3 The provisions of this Schedule referred to in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) are\u2014 a paragraph 3(4), (6)(b), (c) and (d) and (7)(b) and (c), b paragraph 6(1)(e), c paragraph 11, d paragraph 14(2), and e paragraph 16. 4 Where the child of a person (\u201cP\u201d) has an interest in a dwelling which is situated in a country or territory outside England, Wales and Northern Ireland, P and any spouse or civil partner of P are to be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as having that interest. 5 But sub-paragraph (4) does not apply in relation to a spouse or civil partner of P if the two of them are not living together. 6 Sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 9 applies for the purposes of sub-paragraph (5) of this paragraph as it applies for the purposes of that paragraph. What counts as a dwelling 18 1 This paragraph sets out rules for determining what counts as a dwelling for the purposes of this Schedule. 2 A building or part of a building counts as a dwelling if\u2014 a it is used or suitable for use as a single dwelling, or b it is in the process of being constructed or adapted for such use. 3 Land that is, or is to be, occupied or enjoyed with a dwelling as a garden or grounds (including any building or structure on that land) is taken to be part of that dwelling. 4 Land that subsists, or is to subsist, for the benefit of a dwelling is taken to be part of that dwelling. 5 The main subject-matter of a transaction is also taken to consist of or include an interest in a dwelling if\u2014 a substantial performance of a contract constitutes the effective date of that transaction by virtue of a relevant deeming provision, b the main subject-matter of the transaction consists of or includes an interest in a building, or a part of a building, that is to be constructed or adapted under the contract for use as a single dwelling, and c construction or adaptation of the building, or part of a building, has not begun by the time the contract is substantially performed. 6 In sub-paragraph (5)\u2014 \u201c contract \u201d includes any agreement; \u201c relevant deeming provision \u201d means any of sections 44 to 45A or paragraph 5(1) or (2) of Schedule 2A or paragraph 12A of Schedule 17A; \u201c substantially performed \u201d has the same meaning as in section 44. 7 A building or part of a building used for a purpose specified in section 116(2) or (3) is not used as a dwelling for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) or (5). 8 Where a building or part of a building is used for a purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (7), no account is to be taken for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) of its suitability for any other use. Power to modify this Schedule 19 1 The Treasury may by regulations amend or otherwise modify this Schedule for the purpose of preventing certain chargeable transactions from being higher rates transactions for the purposes of paragraph 1. 2 The provision which may be included in regulations under this paragraph by reason of section 114(6)(c) includes incidental or consequential provision which may cause a chargeable transaction to be a higher rates transaction for the purposes of paragraph 1. 4 In paragraph 5 of Schedule 6B (relief for transfers involving multiple dwellings) after sub-paragraph (6) insert\u2014 6A In the application of sub-paragraph (1), account is to be taken of paragraph 1 of Schedule 4ZA if the relevant transaction is a higher rates transaction for the purposes of that paragraph. 5 The amendments made by this section have effect in relation to any land transaction of which the effective date is, or is after, 1 April 2016. 6 But those amendments do not have effect in relation to a transaction\u2014 a effected in pursuance of a contract entered into and substantially performed before 26 November 2015, or b effected in pursuance of a contract entered into before that date and not excluded by subsection (7). 7 A transaction effected in pursuance of a contract entered into before 26 November 2015 is excluded by this subsection if\u2014 a there is any variation of the contract, or assignment of rights under the contract, on or after 26 November 2015, b the transaction is effected in consequence of the exercise on or after that date of any option, right of pre-emption or similar right, or c on or after that date there is an assignment, subsale or other transaction relating to the whole or part of the subject-matter of the contract as a result of which a person other than the purchaser under the contract becomes entitled to call for a conveyance. 8 Subsection (9) applies in relation to a land transaction of which the effective date is or is before 26 November 2018. 9 In its application for the purpose of determining whether a land transaction to which this subsection applies is a higher rates transaction, paragraph 3(6) of Schedule 4ZA to FA 2003 has effect with the following modifications\u2014 a in paragraph (b) for  \u201cduring the period of three years ending with\u201d substitute  \u201c                        the

that arrangements are entered into between a person (\u201c the lessee \u201d) and a financial institution under which the institution\u2014 a purchases a major interest in land (\u201cthe first transaction\u201d), b grants to the lessee out of that interest a lease (if the interest acquired is the interest of the owner) or a sub-lease (if the interest acquired is the tenant's right over or interest in a property subject to a lease) (\u201cthe second transaction\u201d), and c enters into an agreement under which the lessee has a right to require the institution to transfer the major interest purchased by the institution under the first transaction. 3 Condition B is that the land in which the institution purchases a major interest under the first transaction is in Scotland and consists of or includes one or more dwellings or parts of a dwelling. 4 If the lessee is a company, this Part has effect in relation to times when the arrangements are in operation (see subsection (5)) as if\u2014 a the interest held by the financial institution as mentioned in subsection (5)(b) were held by the lessee (and not by the financial institution), and b the lease or sub-lease granted under the second transaction had not been granted. 5 The reference in subsection (4) to times when the arrangements are in operation is to times when\u2014 a the lessee holds the interest granted to it under the second transaction, and b the interest purchased under the first transaction is held by a financial institution. 6 A company treated under subsection (4)(a) as holding an interest at a particular time is treated as holding it as a member of a partnership if at the time in question the company holds the interest granted to it under the second transaction as a member of the partnership (and this Part has effect accordingly in relation to the other members of the partnership). 7 In relation to times when the arrangements operate for the benefit of a collective investment scheme (see subsection (8)), this Part has effect as if\u2014 a the interest held by the financial institution as mentioned in subsection (8)(b) were held by the lessee for the purposes of a collective investment scheme (and were not held by the financial institution), and b the lease or sub-lease granted under the second transaction had not been granted. 8 The reference in subsection (7) to times when the arrangements operate for the benefit of a collective investment scheme is to times when\u2014 a the lessee holds the interest granted to it under the second transaction for the purposes of a collective investment scheme, and b the interest purchased under the first transaction is held by a financial institution. 9 In this section  \u201c financial institution \u201d has the same meaning as in section 71A of FA 2003 (see section 73BA of that Act). 10 References in this section to a  \u201cmajor interest\u201d in land are to\u2014 a ownership of land, or b the tenant's

Notice of proposal to bind arrangements to counteracted arrangements 2 1 This paragraph applies where a counteraction notice has been given to a person in relation to any tax arrangements (the  \u201ccounteracted arrangements\u201d) which are in a pool created under paragraph 1. 2 If a designated HMRC officer considers\u2014 a that a tax advantage has arisen to another person (\u201cR\u201d) from tax arrangements that are abusive, b that those tax arrangements (\u201cR's arrangements\u201d) are equivalent to the counteracted arrangements, and c that the advantage ought to be counteracted under section 209, the officer may give R a notice (a  \u201cnotice of binding\u201d) in relation to R's arrangements. 3 The officer may not give R a notice of binding if R has been given in respect of R's arrangements a notice under\u2014 a paragraph 1, or b paragraph 3 of Schedule 43. 4 In this paragraph  \u201c counteraction notice \u201d means a notice such as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 12 of Schedule 43 or sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 8 of Schedule 43B (notice of final decision to counteract). 3 1 The decision whether or not to give R a pooling notice or notice of binding must be taken, and any notice must be given, as soon as is reasonably practicable after HMRC becomes aware of the relevant facts. 2 A pooling notice or notice of binding must\u2014 a specify the tax arrangements in relation to which the notice is given and the tax advantage, b explain why the officer considers R's arrangements to be equivalent to the lead arrangements or the counteracted arrangements (as the case may be), c explain why the officer considers that a tax advantage has arisen to R from tax arrangements that are abusive, d set out the counteraction that the officer considers ought to be taken, and e explain the effect of\u2014 i paragraphs 4 to 10, ii subsection (9) of section 209, and iii section 212A. 3 A pooling notice or notice of binding may set out steps that R may (subject to subsection (9) of section 209) take to avoid the proposed counteraction. Corrective action by a notified taxpayer 4 1 If a person to whom a pooling notice or notice of binding has been given takes the relevant corrective action in relation to the tax arrangements and tax advantage specified in the notice before the beginning of the closed period mentioned in section 209(9), the person is to be treated for the purposes of paragraphs 8 and 9 and Schedule 43B (generic referral of tax arrangements) as not having been given the notice in question (and accordingly the tax arrangements in question are no longer in the pool). 2 For the purposes of this Schedule the  \u201crelevant corrective action\u201d is taken if (and only if) the person takes the steps set out in sub-paragraphs (3) and (4). 3 The first step is that\u2014 a the person amends a return or claim to counteract the tax advantage specified in the pooling notice or notice of binding, or b if the person has made a tax appeal (by notifying HMRC or otherwise) on the basis that the tax advantage specified in the pooling notice or notice of binding arises from the tax arrangements specified in that notice, the person takes all necessary action to enter into an agreement with HMRC (in writing) for the purpose of relinquishing that advantage. 4 The second step is that the person notifies HMRC\u2014 a that the first step has been taken, and b of any additional amount which has or will become due and payable in respect of tax by reason of the first step being taken. 5 Where a person takes the first step described in sub-paragraph (3)(b), HMRC may proceed as if the person had not taken the relevant corrective action if the person fails to enter into the written agreement. 6 In determining the additional amount which has or will become due and payable in respect of tax for the purposes of sub-paragraph (4)(b), it is to be assumed that, where the person takes the necessary action as mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)(b), the agreement is then entered into. 7 No enactment limiting the time during which amendments may be made to returns or claims operates to prevent the person taking the first step mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)(a) before the tax enquiry is closed. 8 No appeal may be brought, by virtue of a provision mentioned in sub-paragraph (9), against an amendment made by a closure notice in respect of a tax enquiry to the extent that the amendment takes into account an amendment made by the taxpayer to a return or claim in taking the first step mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)(a). 9 The provisions are\u2014 a paragraph 35(1)(b) of Schedule 33, b section 31(1)(b) or (c) of TMA 1970, c paragraph 9 of Schedule 1A to TMA 1970, d paragraph 34(3) of Schedule 18 to FA 1998, and e paragraph 35(1)(b) of Schedule 10 to FA 2003. Corrective action by lead taxpayer 5 If the person mentioned in paragraph 1(1) takes the relevant corrective action (as defined in paragraph 4A of Schedule 43) before the end of the period of 75 days beginning with the day on which the notice mentioned in paragraph 1(1) was given to that person, the lead arrangements are treated as ceasing to be in the pool. Opinion notices and right to make representations 6 1 Sub-paragraph (2) applies where\u2014 a a pooling notice is given to a person in relation to any tax arrangements, and b an opinion notice (or opinion notices) under paragraph 11(2) of Schedule 43 about another set of tax arrangements in the pool (\u201cthe referred arrangements\u201d) is subsequently given to a designated HMRC officer. 2 The officer must give the person a pooled arrangements opinion notice. 3 No more than one pooled arrangements opinion notice may be given to a person in respect of the same tax arrangements. 4 Where a designated HMRC officer gives a person a notice of binding, the officer must, at the same time, give the person a bound arrangements opinion notice. 7 1 In relation to a person who is, or has been, given a pooling notice,  \u201c pooled arrangements opinion notice \u201d means a written notice which\u2014 a sets out a report prepared by HMRC of any opinion of the GAAR Advisory Panel about the referred arrangements, b explains the person's right to make representations falling within sub-paragraph (3), and c sets out the period in which those representations may be made. 2 In relation to a person who is given a notice of binding  \u201c bound arrangements opinion notice \u201d means a written notice which\u2014 a sets out a report prepared by HMRC of any opinion of the GAAR Advisory Panel about the counteracted arrangements (see paragraph 2(1)), b explains the person's right to make representations falling within sub-paragraph (3), and c sets out the period in which those representations may be made. 3 A person who is given a pooled arrangements opinion notice or a bound arrangements opinion notice has 30 days beginning with the day on which the notice is given to make representations in any of the following categories\u2014 a representations that no tax advantage has arisen to the person from the arrangements to which the notice relates; b representations as to why the arrangements to which the notice relates are or may be materially different from\u2014 i the referred arrangements (in the case of a pooled arrangements opinion notice), or ii the counteracted arrangements (in the case of a bound arrangements opinion notice). 4 In sub-paragraph (3)(b) references to  \u201carrangements\u201d include any circumstances which would be relevant in accordance with section 207 to a determination of whether the tax arrangements in question are abusive. Notice of final decision 8 1 This paragraph applies where\u2014 a any tax arrangements have been placed in a pool by a notice given to a person under paragraph 1, and b a designated HMRC officer has given a notice under paragraph 12 of Schedule 43 in relation to any other arrangements in the pool (the  \u201creferred arrangements\u201d). 2 The officer must, having considered any opinion of the GAAR Advisory Panel about the referred arrangements and any representations made under paragraph 7(3) in relation to the arrangements mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a), give the person a written notice setting out whether the tax advantage arising from those arrangements is to be counteracted under the general anti-abuse rule. 9 1 This paragraph applies where\u2014 a a person has been given a notice of binding under paragraph 2, and b the period of 30 days for making representations under paragraph 7(3) has expired. 2 A designated HMRC officer must, having considered any opinion of the GAAR Advisory Panel about the counteracted arrangements and any representations made under paragraph 7(3) in relation to the arrangements specified in the notice of binding, give the person a written notice setting out whether the tax advantage arising from the arrangements specified in the notice of binding is to be counteracted under the general anti-abuse rule. 10 If a notice under paragraph 8(2) or 9(2) states that a tax advantage is to be counteracted, it must also set out\u2014 a the adjustments required to give effect to the counteraction, and b if relevant, any steps the person concerned is required to take to give effect to it.                               \u201cEquivalent arrangements\u201d                             11 1 For the purposes of paragraph 1, tax arrangements are  \u201cequivalent\u201d to one another if they are substantially the same as one another having regard to\u2014 a their substantive results, b the means of achieving those results, and c the characteristics on the basis of which it could reasonably be argued, in each case, that the arrangements are abusive tax arrangements under which a tax advantage has arisen to a person. Notices may be given on assumption that tax advantage does arise 12 1 A designated HMRC officer may give a notice, or do anything else, under this Schedule where the officer considers that a tax advantage might have arisen to the person concerned. 2 Accordingly, any notice given by a designated HMRC officer under this Schedule may be expressed to be given on the assumption that a tax advantage does arise (without conceding that it does). Power to amend 13 1 The Treasury may by regulations amend this Schedule (apart from this paragraph). 2 Regulations under sub-paragraph (1) may include\u2014 a any amendment of this Part that is appropriate in consequence of an amendment by virtue of sub-paragraph (1); b transitional provision. 3 Regulations under sub-paragraph (1) are to be made by statutory instrument. 4 A statutory instrument containing regulations under sub-paragraph (1) is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the House of Commons. 3 After Schedule 43A insert\u2014 SCHEDULE 43B Procedural requirements: generic referral of tax arrangements Notice of proposal to make generic referral of tax arrangements 1 1 Sub-paragraph (2) applies if\u2014 a pooling notices given under paragraph 1 of Schedule 43A have placed one or more sets of tax arrangements in a pool with the lead arrangements, b the lead arrangements (see paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 43A) have ceased to be in the pool, and c no referral under paragraph 5 or 6 of Schedule 43 has been made in respect of any arrangements in the pool. 2 A designated HMRC officer may determine that, in respect of each of the tax arrangements that are in the pool, there is to be given (to the person to whom the pooling notice in question was given) a written notice of a proposal to make a generic referral to the GAAR Advisory Panel in respect of the arrangements in the pool. 3 Only one determination under sub-paragraph (2) may be made in relation to any one pool. 4 The persons to whom those notices are given are  \u201cthe notified taxpayers\u201d. 5 A notice given to a person (\u201cT\u201d) under sub-paragraph (2) must\u2014 a specify the arrangements (the  \u201cspecified arrangements\u201d) and the tax advantage (the  \u201cspecified advantage\u201d) to which the notice relates, b inform T of the period under paragraph 2 for making a proposal. 2 1 T has 30 days beginning with the day on which the notice under paragraph 1 is given to propose to HMRC that it\u2014 a should give T a notice under paragraph 3 of Schedule 43 in respect of the arrangements to which the notice under paragraph 1 relates, and b should not proceed with the proposal to make a generic referral to the GAAR Advisory Panel in respect of those arrangements. 2 If a proposal is made in accordance with sub-paragraph (1) a designated HMRC officer must consider it. Generic referral 3 1 This paragraph applies where a designated HMRC officer has given notices to the notified taxpayers in accordance with paragraph 1(2). 2 If none of the notified taxpayers has made a proposal under paragraph 2 by the end of the 30 day period mentioned in that paragraph, the officer must make a referral to the GAAR Advisory Panel in respect of the notified taxpayers and the arrangements which are specified arrangements in relation to them. 3 If at least one of the notified taxpayers makes a proposal in accordance with paragraph 2, the designated HMRC officer must, after the end of that 30 day period, decide whether to\u2014 a give a notice under paragraph 3 of Schedule 43 in respect of one set of tax arrangements in the relevant pool, or b make a referral to the GAAR Advisory Panel in respect of the tax arrangements in the relevant pool. 4 A referral under this paragraph is a  \u201cgeneric referral\u201d. 4 1 If a generic referral is made to the GAAR Advisory Panel, the designated HMRC officer must at the same time provide it with\u2014 a a general statement of the material characteristics of the specified arrangements, and b a declaration that\u2014 i the statement under paragraph (a) is applicable to all the specified arrangements, and ii as far as HMRC is aware, nothing which is material to the GAAR Advisory Panel's consideration of the matter has been omitted. 2 The general statement under sub-paragraph (1)(a) must\u2014 a contain a factual description of the tax arrangements; b set out HMRC's view as to whether the tax arrangements accord with established practice (when the arrangements were entered into); c explain why it is the designated HMRC officer's view that a tax advantage of the nature described in the statement and arising from tax arrangements having the characteristics described in the statement would be a tax advantage arising from arrangements that are abusive; d set out any matters the designated officer is aware of which may suggest that any view of HMRC or the designated HMRC officer expressed in the general statement is not correct; e set out any other matters which the designated officer considers are required for the purposes of the exercise of the GAAR Advisory Panel's functions under paragraph 6. 5 If a generic referral is made the designated HMRC officer must at the same time give each of the notified taxpayers a notice which\u2014 a specifies that a generic referral is being made, and b is accompanied by a copy of the statement given to the GAAR Advisory Panel in accordance with paragraph 4(1)(a). Decision of GAAR Advisory Panel and opinion notices 6 1 If a generic referral is made to the GAAR Advisory Panel under paragraph 3, the Chair must arrange for a sub-panel consisting of 3 members of the GAAR Advisory Panel (one of whom may be the Chair) to consider it. 2 The sub-panel must produce\u2014 a one opinion notice stating the joint opinion of all the members of the sub-panel, or b two or three opinion notices which taken together state the opinions of all the members. 3 The sub-panel must give a copy of the opinion notice or notices to the designated HMRC officer. 4 An opinion notice is a notice which states that in the opinion of the members of the sub-panel, or one or more of those members\u2014 a the entering into and carrying out of tax arrangements such as are described in the general statement under paragraph 4(1)(a) is a reasonable course of action in relation to the relevant tax provisions, b the entering into or carrying out of such tax arrangements is not a reasonable course of action in relation to the relevant tax provisions, or c it is not possible, on the information available, to reach a view on that matter, and the reasons for that opinion. 5 In forming their opinions for the purposes of sub-paragraph (4) members of the sub-panel must\u2014 a have regard to all the matters set out in the statement under paragraph 4(1)(a), b assume (unless the contrary is stated in the statement under paragraph 4(1)(a)) that the tax arrangements do not form part of any other arrangements, c have regard to the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (c) of section 207(2), and d take account of subsections (4) to (6) of section 207. 6 For the purposes of the giving of an opinion under this paragraph, the arrangements are to be assumed to be tax arrangements. 7 In this Part, a reference to any opinion of the GAAR Advisory Panel in respect of a generic referral of any tax arrangements is a reference to the contents of any opinion notice given in relation to a generic referral in respect of the arrangements. Notice of right to make representations 7 1 Where a designated HMRC officer is given an opinion notice (or opinion notices) under paragraph 6, the officer must give each of the notified taxpayers a copy of the opinion notice (or notices) and a written notice which\u2014 a explains the notified taxpayer's right to make representations falling within sub-paragraph (2), and b sets out the period in which those representations may be made. 2 A notified taxpayer (\u201cT\u201d) who is given a notice under sub-paragraph (1) has 30 days beginning with the day on which the notice is given to make representations in any of the following categories\u2014 a representations that no tax advantage has arisen from the specified arrangements; b representations that T has already been given a notice under paragraph 6 of Schedule 43A in relation to the specified arrangements; c representations that any matter set out in the statement under paragraph 4(1)(a) is materially inaccurate as regards the specified arrangements (having regard to all circumstances which would be relevant in accordance with section 207 to a determination of whether the tax arrangements in question are abusive). Notice of final decision after considering opinion of GAAR Advisory Panel 8 1 A designated HMRC officer who has received a copy of a notice or notices under paragraph 6(3) in respect of a generic referral must consider the case of each notified taxpayer in accordance with sub-paragraph (2). 2 The officer must, having considered\u2014 a any opinion of the GAAR Advisory Panel about the matters referred to it, and b any representations made by the notified taxpayer under paragraph 7, give to the notified taxpayer a written notice setting out whether the specified advantage is to be counteracted under the general anti-abuse rule. 3 If the notice states that a tax advantage is to be counteracted, it must also set out\u2014 a the adjustments required to give effect to the counteraction, and b if relevant, any steps that the taxpayer is required to take to give effect to it. Notices may be given on assumption that tax advantage does arise 9 1 A designated HMRC officer may give a notice, or do anything else, under this Schedule where the officer considers that a tax advantage might have arisen to the person concerned. 2 Accordingly, any notice given by a designated HMRC officer under this Schedule may be expressed to be given on the assumption that a tax advantage does arise (without conceding that it does). Power to amend 10 1 The Treasury may by regulations amend this Schedule (apart from this paragraph). 2 Regulations under sub-paragraph (1) may include\u2014 a any amendment of this Part that is appropriate in consequence of an amendment by virtue of sub-paragraph (1);

Value of the counteracted advantage: basic rule 2 1 The  \u201cvalue of the counteracted advantage\u201d is the additional amount due or payable in respect of tax as a result of the counteraction mentioned in section 212A(1)(c). 2 The reference in sub-paragraph (1) to the additional amount due and payable includes a reference to\u2014 a an amount payable to HMRC having erroneously been paid by way of repayment of tax, and b an amount which would be repayable by HMRC if the counteraction were not made. 3 The following are ignored in calculating the value of the counteracted advantage\u2014 a group relief, and b any relief under section 458 of CTA 2010 (relief in respect of repayment etc of loan) which is deferred under subsection (5) of that section. 4 For the purposes of this paragraph consequential adjustments under section 210 are regarded as part of the counteraction in question. 5 If the counteraction affects the person's liability to two or more taxes, the taxes concerned are to be considered together for the purpose of determining the value of the counteracted advantage. 6 This paragraph is subject to paragraphs 3 and 4. Value of counteracted advantage: losses 3 1 To the extent that the tax advantage mentioned in section 212A(1)(b) (\u201cthe tax advantage\u201d) resulted in the wrong recording of a loss for the purposes of direct tax and the loss has been wholly used to reduce the amount due or payable in respect of tax, the value of the counteracted advantage is determined in accordance with paragraph 2. 2 To the extent that the tax advantage resulted in the wrong recording of a loss for purposes of direct tax and the loss has not been wholly used to reduce the amount due or payable in respect of tax, the value of the counteracted advantage is\u2014 a the value under paragraph 2 of so much of the tax advantage as results (or would in the absence of the counteraction result) from the part (if any) of the loss which was used to reduce the amount due or payable in respect of tax, plus b 10% of the part of the loss not so used. 3 Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply both\u2014 a to a case where no loss would have been recorded but for the tax advantage, and b to a case where a loss of a different amount would have been recorded (but in that case sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply only to the difference between the amount recorded and the true amount). 4 To the extent that the tax advantage creates or increases (or would in the absence of the counteraction create or increase) an aggregate loss recorded for a group of companies\u2014 a the value of the counteracted advantage is calculated in accordance with this paragraph, and b in applying paragraph 2 in accordance with sub-paragraphs (1) and (2), group relief may be taken into account (despite paragraph 2(3)). 5 To the extent that the tax advantage results (or would in the absence of the counteraction result) in a loss, the value of it is nil where, because of the nature of the loss or the person's circumstances, there was no reasonable prospect of the loss being used to support a claim to reduce a tax liability (of any person). Value of counteracted advantage: deferred tax 4 1 To the extent that the tax advantage mentioned in section 212A is a deferral of tax, the value of the counteracted advantage is\u2014 a 25% of the amount of the deferred tax for each year of the deferral, or b a percentage of the amount of the deferred tax, for each separate period of deferral of less than a year, equating to 25% per year, or, if less, 100% of the amount of the deferred tax. 2 This paragraph does not apply to a case to the extent that paragraph 3 applies. Assessment of penalty 5 1 Where a person is liable for a penalty under section 212A, HMRC must assess the penalty. 2 Where HMRC assess the penalty, HMRC must\u2014 a notify the person who is liable for the penalty, and b state in the notice a tax period in respect of which the penalty is assessed. 3 A penalty under this paragraph must be paid before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which notification of the penalty is issued. 4 An assessment\u2014 a is to be treated for procedural purposes as if it were an assessment to tax, b may be enforced as if it were an assessment to tax, and c may be combined with an assessment to tax. 5 An assessment of a penalty under this paragraph must be made before the end of the period of 12 months beginning with\u2014 a the end of the appeal period for the assessment which gave effect to the counteraction mentioned in section 212A(1)(b), or b if there is no assessment within paragraph (a), the date (or the latest of the dates) on which that counteraction becomes final. 6 The reference in sub-paragraph (5)(b) to the counteraction becoming final is to be interpreted in accordance with section 210(8). Alteration of assessment of penalty 6 1 After notification of an assessment has been given to a person under paragraph 5(2), the assessment may not be altered except in accordance with this paragraph or paragraph 7, or on appeal. 2 A supplementary assessment may be made in respect of a penalty if an earlier assessment operated by reference to an underestimate of the value of the counteracted advantage. 3 An assessment may be revised as necessary if it operated by reference to an overestimate of the value of the counteracted advantage. Revision of assessment following consequential relieving adjustment 7 1 Sub-paragraph (2) applies where a person\u2014 a is notified under section 210(7) of a consequential adjustment relating to a counteraction under section 209, and b an assessment to a penalty in respect of that counteraction of which the person has been notified under paragraph 5(2) does not take account of that consequential adjustment. 2 HMRC must make any alterations of the assessment that appear to HMRC to be just and reasonable in connection with the consequential amendment. 3 Alterations under this paragraph may be made despite any time limit imposed by or under an enactment. Aggregate penalties 8 1 Sub-paragraph (3) applies where\u2014 a two or more penalties are incurred by the same person and fall to be determined by reference to an amount of tax to which that person is chargeable, b one of those penalties is incurred under section 212A, and c one or more of the other penalties are incurred under a relevant penalty provision. 2 But sub-paragraph (3) does not apply if section 212(2) of FA 2014 (follower notices: aggregate penalties) applies in relation to the amount of tax in question. 3 The aggregate of the amounts of the penalties mentioned in subsection (1)(b) and (c), so far as determined by reference to that amount of tax, must not exceed\u2014 a the relevant percentage of that amount, or b in a case where at least one of the penalties is under paragraph 5(2)(b) of, or sub-paragraph (3)(b), (4)(b) or (5)(b) of paragraph 6 of, Schedule 55 to FA 2009, \u00a3300 (if greater). 4 In the application of section 97A of TMA 1970 (multiple penalties) no account shall be taken of a penalty under section 212A. 5 \u201c Relevant penalty provision \u201d means\u2014 a Schedule 24 to FA 2007 (penalties for errors), b Schedule 41 to FA 2008 (penalties: failure to notify etc), c Schedule 55 to FA 2009 (penalties for failure to make returns etc), or d Part 5 of Schedule 18 to FA 2016 (penalty under serial tax avoidance regime). 6 \u201c The relevant percentage \u201d means\u2014 a 200% in a case where at least one of the penalties is determined by reference to the percentage in\u2014 i paragraph 4(4)(c) of Schedule 24 to FA 2007, ii paragraph 6(4)(a) of Schedule 41 to FA 2008, or iii paragraph 6(3A)(c) of Schedule 55 to FA 2009, b 150% in a case where paragraph (a) does not apply and at least one of the penalties is determined by reference to the percentage in\u2014 i paragraph 4(3)(c) of Schedule 24 to FA 2007, ii paragraph 6(3)(a) of Schedule 41 to FA 2008, or iii paragraph 6(3A)(b) of Schedule 55 to FA 2009, c 140% in a case where neither paragraph (a) nor paragraph (b) applies and at least one of the penalties is determined by reference to the percentage in\u2014 i paragraph 4(4)(b) of Schedule 24 to FA 2007, ii paragraph 6(4)(b) of Schedule 41 to FA 2008, or iii paragraph 6(4A)(c) of Schedule 55 to FA 2009, d 105% in a case where at none of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) applies and at least one of the penalties is determined by reference to the percentage in\u2014 i paragraph 4(3)(b) of Schedule 24 to FA 2007, ii paragraph 6(3)(b) of Schedule 41 to FA 2008, or iii paragraph 6(4A)(b) of Schedule 55 to FA 2009, and e in any other case, 100%. Appeal against penalty 9 1 A person may appeal against\u2014 a the imposition of a penalty under section 212A, or b the amount assessed under paragraph 5. 2 An appeal under sub-paragraph (1)(a) may only be made on the grounds that the arrangements were not abusive or there was no tax advantage to be counteracted. 3 An appeal under sub-paragraph (1)(b) may only be made on the grounds that the assessment was based on an overestimate of the value of the counteracted advantage (whether because the estimate was made by reference to adjustments which were not just and reasonable or for any other reason). 4 An appeal under this paragraph must be made within the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which notification of the penalty is given under paragraph 5(2). 5 An appeal under this paragraph is to be treated in the same way as an appeal against an assessment to the tax concerned (including by the application of any provision about bringing the appeal by notice to HMRC, about HMRC's review of the decision or about determination of the appeal by the First-tier Tribunal or Upper Tribunal). 6 Sub-paragraph (5) does not apply\u2014 a so as to require a person to pay a penalty before an appeal against the assessment of the penalty is determined, or b in respect of any other matter expressly provided for by this Part. 7 On an appeal against the penalty the tribunal may affirm or cancel HMRC's decision. 8 On an appeal against the amount of the penalty the tribunal may\u2014 a affirm HMRC's decision, or b substitute for HMRC's decision another decision that HMRC has power to make. 9 In this paragraph  \u201c tribunal \u201d means the First-tier Tribunal or Upper Tribunal (as appropriate by virtue of sub-paragraph (5)). Mitigation of penalties 10 1 The Commissioners may in their discretion mitigate a penalty under section 212A, or stay or compound any proceedings for such a penalty. 2 They may also, after judgment, further mitigate or entirely remit the penalty.

Panel under paragraph 5 or 6 of Schedule 43, the taxpayer (as defined in paragraph 3 of that Schedule) must not make any GAAR-related adjustments in relation to the taxpayer's tax affairs in the

corrective action before the beginning of the closed period mentioned in section 209(8), the matter is not to be referred to the GAAR Advisory Panel. 2 For the purposes of this Schedule the  \u201crelevant corrective action\u201d is taken if (and only if) the taxpayer takes the steps set out in sub-paragraphs (3) and (4). 3 The first step is that\u2014 a the taxpayer amends a return or claim to counteract the tax advantage specified in the notice under paragraph 3, or b if the taxpayer has made a tax appeal (by notifying HMRC or otherwise) on the basis that the tax advantage specified in the notice under paragraph 3 arises from the tax arrangements specified in that notice, the taxpayer takes all necessary action to enter into an agreement with HMRC (in writing) for the purpose of relinquishing that advantage. 4 The second step is that the taxpayer notifies HMRC\u2014 a that the taxpayer has taken the first step, and b of any additional amount which has or will become due and payable in respect of tax by reason of the first step being taken. 5 Where the taxpayer takes the first step described in sub-paragraph (3)(b), HMRC may proceed as if the taxpayer had not taken the relevant corrective action if the taxpayer fails to enter into the written agreement. 6 In determining the additional amount which has or will become due and payable in respect of tax for the purposes of sub-paragraph (4)(b), it is to be assumed that, where the taxpayer takes the necessary action as mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)(b), the agreement is then entered into. 7 No enactment limiting the time during which amendments may be made to returns or claims operates to prevent the taxpayer taking the first step mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)(a) before the tax enquiry is closed (whether or not before the specified time). 8 No appeal may be brought, by virtue of a provision mentioned in sub-paragraph (9), against an amendment made by a closure notice in respect of a tax enquiry to the extent that the amendment takes into account an amendment made by the taxpayer to a return or claim in taking the first step mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)(a). 9 The provisions are\u2014 a section 31(1)(b) or (c) of TMA 1970, b paragraph 9 of Schedule 1A to TMA 1970, c paragraph 34(3) of Schedule 18 to FA 1998, d paragraph 35(1)(b) of Schedule 10 to FA 2003, and e paragraph 35(1)(b) of Schedule 33 to FA 2013. 9 Before paragraph 5 (but after the heading  \u201cReferral to GAAR Advisory Panel\u201d) insert\u2014 4B Paragraphs 5 and 6 apply if the taxpayer does not take the relevant corrective action (see paragraph 4A) by the beginning of the closed period mentioned in section 209(8). 10 In section 103ZA of TMA 1970 (disapplication of sections 100 to 103 in the case of certain penalties)\u2014 a omit  \u201cor\u201d at the end of paragraph (g), and b after paragraph (g) insert ga section 212A of the Finance Act 2013 (general anti-abuse rule), or 11 In section 212 of

follows. 2 After section 237 insert\u2014 Duty to give conduct notice: defeat of promoted arrangements 237A 1 If an authorised officer becomes aware at any time (\u201c the relevant time \u201d) that a person (  \u201c                              P                            \u201d ) who is carrying on a business as a promoter meets any of the conditions in subsections (11) to (13), the officer must determine whether or not P's meeting of that condition should be regarded as significant in view of the purposes of this Part. But see also subsection (14). 2 An authorised officer must make the determination set out in subsection (3) if the officer becomes aware at any time (  \u201c                              the section 237A(2) relevant time                            \u201d ) that\u2014 a a person meets a condition in subsection (11), (12) or (13), and b at the section 237A(2) relevant time another person (\u201cP\u201d), who is carrying on a business as a promoter, meets that condition by virtue of Part 4 of Schedule 34A (meeting the section 237A conditions: bodies corporate and partnerships). 3 The authorised officer must determine whether or not\u2014 a the meeting of the condition by the person as mentioned in subsection (2)(a), and b P's meeting of the condition as mentioned in subsection (2)(b), should be regarded as significant in view of the purposes of this Part. 4 Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply if a conduct notice or monitoring notice already has effect in relation to P. 5 Subsection (1) does not apply if, at the relevant time, an authorised officer is under a duty to make a determination under section 237(5) in relation to P. 6 Subsection (2) does not apply if, at the section 237A(2) relevant time, an authorised officer is under a duty to make a determination under section 237(5) in relation to P. 7 But in a case where subsection (1) does not apply because of subsection (5), or subsection (2) does not apply because of subsection (6), subsection (5) of section 237 has effect as if\u2014 a the references in paragraph (a) of that subsection to  \u201csubsection (1)\u201d, and  \u201csubsection (1)(a)\u201d included subsection (1) of this section, and b in paragraph (b) of that subsection the reference to  \u201csubsection (1A)(a)\u201d included a reference to subsection (2)(a) of this section and the reference to subsection (1A)(b) included a reference to subsection (2)(b) of this section. 8 If the authorised officer determines under subsection (1) that P's meeting of the condition in question should be regarded as significant, the officer must give P a conduct notice, unless subsection (10) applies. 9 If the authorised officer determines under subsection (3) that\u2014 a the meeting of the condition by the person as mentioned in subsection (2)(a), and b P's meeting of the condition as mentioned in subsection (2)(b), should be regarded as significant in view of the purposes of this Part, the officer must give P a conduct notice, unless subsection (10) applies. 10 This subsection applies if the authorised officer determines that, having regard to the extent of the impact that P's activities as a promoter are likely to have on the collection of tax, it is inappropriate to give P a conduct notice. 11 The condition in this subsection is that in the period of 3 years ending with the relevant time at least 3 relevant defeats have occurred in relation to P. 12 The condition in this subsection is that at least two relevant defeats have occurred in relation to P at times when a single defeat notice under section 241A(2) or (6) had effect in relation to P. 13 The condition in this subsection is that at least one relevant defeat has occurred in relation to P at a time when a double defeat notice under section 241A(3) had effect in relation to P. 14 A determination that the condition in subsection (12) or (13) is met cannot be made unless\u2014 a the defeat notice in question still has effect when the determination is made, or b the determination is made on or before the 90th day after the day on which the defeat notice in question ceased to have effect. 15 Schedule 34A sets out the circumstances in which a  \u201crelevant defeat\u201d occurs in relation to a person and includes provision limiting what can amount to a further relevant defeat in relation to a person (see paragraph 6). Duty to give further conduct notice where provisional notice not complied with 237B 1 An authorised officer must give a conduct notice to a person (\u201cP\u201d) who is carrying on a business as a promoter if\u2014 a a conduct notice given to P under section 237A(8)\u2014 i has ceased to have effect otherwise than as a result of section 237D(2) or 241(3) or (4), and ii was provisional immediately before it ceased to have effect, b the officer determines that P had failed to comply with one or more conditions in the conduct notice, c the conduct notice relied on a Case 3 relevant defeat, d since the time when the conduct notice ceased to have effect, one or more relevant defeats falling within subsection (2) have occurred in relation to\u2014 i P, and ii any arrangements to which the Case 3 relevant defeat also relates, and e had that relevant defeat or (as the case may be) those relevant defeats, occurred before the conduct notice ceased to have effect, an authorised officer would have been required to notify the person under section 237C(3) that the notice was no longer provisional. 2 A relevant defeat falls within this subsection if it occurs by virtue of Case 1 or Case 2 in Schedule 34A. 3 Subsection (1) does not apply if the authorised officer determines that, having regard to the extent of the impact that the person's activities as a promoter are likely to have on the collection of tax, it is inappropriate to give the person a conduct notice. 4 Subsection (1) does not apply if a conduct notice or monitoring notice already has effect in relation to the person. 5 For the purposes of this Part a conduct notice  \u201crelies on a Case 3 relevant defeat\u201d if it could not have been given under the following condition. The condition is that paragraph 9 of Schedule 34A had effect with the substitution of  \u201c                              100% of the tested arrangements                            \u201d  for \u201c75% of the tested arrangements\u201d. When a conduct notice given under section 237A(8) is  \u201cprovisional\u201d 237C 1 This section applies to a conduct notice which\u2014 a is given to a person under section 237A(8), and b relies on a Case 3 relevant defeat. 2 The notice is  \u201cprovisional\u201d at all times when it has effect, unless an authorised officer notifies the person that the notice is no longer provisional. 3 An authorised officer must notify the person that the notice is no longer provisional if subsection (4) or (5) applies. 4 This subsection applies if\u2014 a the condition in subsection (5)(a) is not met, and b a full relevant defeat occurs in relation to P. 5 This subsection applies if\u2014 a two, or all three, of the relevant defeats by reference to which the conduct notice is given would not have been relevant defeats if paragraph 9 of Schedule 34A had effect with the substitution of  \u201c                                  100% of the tested arrangements                                \u201d  for \u201c75% of the tested arrangements\u201d, and b the same number of full relevant defeats occur in relation to P. 6 A  \u201cfull relevant defeat\u201d occurs in relation to P if\u2014 a a relevant defeat occurs in relation to P otherwise than by virtue of Case 3 in paragraph 9 of Schedule 34A, or b circumstances arise which would be a relevant defeat in relation to P by virtue of paragraph 9 of Schedule 34A if that paragraph had effect with the substitution of  \u201c                                  100% of the tested arrangements                                \u201d  for \u201c75% of the tested arrangements\u201d. 7 In determining under subsection (6) whether a full relevant defeat has occurred in relation to P, assume that in paragraph 6 of Schedule 34A (provision limiting what can amount to a further relevant defeat in relation to a person) the first reference to a  \u201c relevant defeat \u201d does not include a relevant defeat by virtue of Case 3 in paragraph 9 of Schedule 34A. Judicial ruling upholding asserted tax advantage: effect on conduct notice which is provisional 237D 1 Subsection (2) applies if at any time\u2014 a a conduct notice which relies on a Case 3 relevant defeat (see section 237B(5)) is provisional, and b a court or tribunal upholds a corresponding tax advantage which has been asserted in connection with any of the related arrangements to which that relevant defeat relates (see paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 34A). 2 The conduct notice ceases to have effect when that judicial ruling becomes final. 3 An authorised officer must give the person to whom the conduct notice was given a written notice stating that the conduct notice has ceased to have effect. 4 For the purposes of this section, a tax advantage is  \u201casserted\u201d in connection with any arrangements if a person makes a return, claim or election on the basis that the tax advantage arises from those arrangements. In relation to the arrangements mentioned in paragraph (b) of subsection (1)  \u201c corresponding tax advantage \u201d means a tax advantage corresponding to any tax advantage the counteraction of which contributed to the relevant defeat mentioned in that paragraph. 5 For the purposes of this section a court or tribunal  \u201cupholds\u201d a tax advantage if\u2014 a the court or tribunal makes a ruling to the effect that no part of the tax advantage is to be counteracted, and b that judicial ruling is final. 6 For the purposes of this Part a judicial ruling is  \u201cfinal\u201d if it is\u2014 a a ruling of the Supreme Court, or b a ruling of any other court or tribunal in circumstances where\u2014 i no appeal may be made against the ruling, ii if an appeal may be made against the ruling with permission, the time limit for applications has expired and either no application has been made or permission has been refused, iii if such permission to appeal against the ruling has been granted or is not required, no appeal has been made within the time limit for appeals, or iv if an appeal was made, it was abandoned or otherwise disposed of before it was determined by the court or tribunal to which it was addressed. 7 In this section references to  \u201ccounteraction\u201d include anything referred to as a counteraction in any of Conditions A to F in paragraphs 11 to 16 of Schedule 34A. 3 After section 241 insert\u2014 Defeat notices Defeat notices 241A 1 This section applies in relation to a person (\u201cP\u201d) only if P is carrying on a business as a promoter. 2 An authorised officer, or an officer of Revenue and Customs with the approval of an authorised officer, may give P a notice if the officer concerned has become aware of one (and only one) relevant defeat which has occurred in relation to P in the period of 3 years ending with the day on which the notice is given. 3 An authorised officer, or an officer of Revenue and Customs with the approval of an authorised officer, may give P a notice if the officer concerned has become aware of two (but not more than two) relevant defeats which have occurred in relation to P in the period of 3 years ending with the day on which the notice is given. 4 A notice under this section must be given by the end of the 90 days beginning with the day on which the matters mentioned in subsection (2) or (as the case may be) (3) come to the attention of HMRC. 5 Subsection (6) applies if\u2014 a a single defeat notice which had been given to P (under subsection (2) or (6)) ceases to have effect as a result of section 241B(1), and b in the period when the defeat notice had effect a relevant defeat (\u201cthe further relevant defeat\u201d) occurred in relation to P. 6 An authorised officer or an officer of Revenue and Customs with the approval of an authorised officer may give P a notice in respect of the further relevant defeat (regardless of whether or not it occurred in the period of 3 years ending with the day on which the notice is given). 7 In this Part\u2014 a \u201c single defeat notice \u201d means a notice under subsection (2) or (6); b \u201c double defeat notice \u201d means a notice under subsection (3); c \u201c defeat notice \u201d means a single defeat notice or a double defeat notice. 8 A defeat notice must\u2014 a set out the dates on which the look-forward period for the notice begins and ends; b in the case of a single defeat notice, explain the effect of section 237A(12); c in the case of a double defeat notice, explain the effect of section 237A(13). 9 HMRC may specify what further information must be included in a defeat notice. 10 \u201cLook-forward period\u201d\u2014 a in relation to a defeat notice under subsection (2) or (3), means the period of 5 years beginning with the day after the day on which the notice is given; b in relation to a defeat notice under subsection (6), means the period beginning with the day after the day on which the notice is given and ending at the end of the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which the further relevant defeat mentioned in subsection (6) occurred in relation to P. 11 A defeat notice has effect throughout its look-forward period unless it ceases to have effect earlier in accordance with section 241B(1) or (4). Judicial ruling upholding asserted tax advantage: effect on defeat notice 241B 1 If the relevant defeat to which a single defeat notice relates is overturned (see subsection (5)), the notice has no further effect on and after the day on which it is overturned. 2 Subsection (3) applies if one (and only one) of the relevant defeats in respect of which a double defeat notice was given is overturned. 3 The notice is to be treated for the purposes of this Part (including this section) as if it had always been a single defeat notice given (in respect of the other of the two relevant defeats) on the date on which the notice was in fact given. The look-forward period for the notice is accordingly unchanged. 4 If both the relevant defeats to which a double defeat notice relates are overturned (on the same date), that notice has no further effect on and after that date. 5 A relevant defeat specified in a defeat notice is  \u201coverturned\u201d if\u2014 a the notice could not have specified that relevant defeat if paragraph 9 of Schedule 34A had effect with the substitution of  \u201c                                    100% of the tested arrangements                                  \u201d  for \u201c75% of the tested arrangements\u201d, and b at a time when the notice has effect a court or tribunal upholds a corresponding tax advantage which has been asserted in connection with any of the related arrangements to which the relevant defeat relates (see paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 34A). Accordingly the relevant defeat is overturned on the day on which the judicial ruling mentioned in paragraph (b) becomes final. 6 If a defeat notice ceases to have effect as a result of subsection (1) or (4) an authorised officer, or an officer of Revenue and Customs with the approval of an authorised officer, must notify the person to whom the notice was given that it has ceased to have effect. 7 If subsection (3) has effect in relation to a defeat notice, an authorised officer, or an officer of Revenue and Customs with the approval of an authorised officer, must notify the person of the effect of that subsection. 8 For the purposes of this section, a tax advantage is  \u201casserted\u201d in connection with any arrangements if a person makes a return, claim or election on the basis that the tax advantage arises from those arrangements. 9 In relation to the arrangements mentioned in paragraph (b) of subsection (5)  \u201c corresponding tax advantage \u201d means a tax advantage corresponding to any tax advantage the counteraction of which contributed to the relevant defeat mentioned in that paragraph. 10 For the purposes of this section a court or tribunal  \u201cupholds\u201d a tax advantage if\u2014 a the court or tribunal makes a ruling to the effect that no part of the tax advantage is to be counteracted, and b that judicial ruling is final. 11 In this section references to  \u201ccounteraction\u201d include anything referred to as a counteraction in any of Conditions A to F in paragraphs 11 to 16 of Schedule 34A. 4 In section 242 (monitoring notices: duty to apply to tribunal), after subsection (5) insert\u2014 6 At a time when a notice given under section 237A is provisional, no determination is to be made under subsection (1) in respect of the notice. 7 If a promoter fails to comply with conditions in a conduct notice at a time when the conduct notice is provisional, nothing in subsection (6) prevents those failures from being taken into account under subsection (1) at any subsequent time when the conduct notice is not provisional. 5 After Schedule 34 insert\u2014 SCHEDULE 34A Promoters of tax avoidance schemes: defeated arrangements  PART 1  Introduction 1 In this Schedule\u2014 a Part 2 is about the meaning of  \u201crelevant defeat\u201d; b Part 3 contains provision about when a relevant defeat is treated as occurring in relation to a person; c Part 4 contains provision about when a person is treated as meeting a condition in subsection (11), (12) or (13) of section 237A; d Part 5 contains definitions and other supplementary provisions.  PART 2  Meaning of  \u201crelevant defeat\u201d                                 \u201cRelated\u201d arrangements 2 1 For the purposes of this Part of this Act, separate arrangements which persons have entered into are  \u201crelated\u201d to one another if (and only if) they are substantially the same. 2 Sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) set out cases in which arrangements are to be treated as being  \u201csubstantially the same\u201d (if they would not otherwise be so treated under sub-paragraph (1)). 3 Arrangements to which the same reference number has been allocated under Part 7 of FA 2004 (disclosure of tax avoidance schemes) are treated as being substantially the same. For this purpose arrangements in relation to which information relating to a reference number has been provided in compliance with section 312 of FA 2004 are treated as arrangements to which that reference number has been allocated under Part 7 of that Act. 4 Arrangements to which the same reference number has been allocated under paragraph 9 of Schedule 11A to VATA 1994 (disclosure of avoidance schemes) are treated as being substantially the same. 5 Any two or more sets of arrangements which are the subject of follower notices given by reference to the same judicial ruling are treated as being substantially the same. 6 Where a notice of binding has been given in relation to any arrangements (\u201cthe bound arrangements\u201d) on the basis that they are, for the purposes of Schedule 43A to FA 2013, equivalent arrangements in relation to another set of arrangements (the  \u201clead arrangements\u201d)\u2014 a the bound arrangements and the lead arrangements are treated as being substantially the same, and b the bound arrangements are treated as being substantially the same as any other arrangements which, as a result of this sub-paragraph, are treated as substantially the same as the lead arrangements.                                 \u201cPromoted arrangements\u201d                               3 1 For the purposes of this Schedule arrangements are  \u201c promoted arrangements \u201d in relation to a person if\u2014 a they are relevant arrangements or would be relevant arrangements under the condition stated in sub-paragraph (2), and b the person is carrying on a business as a promoter and\u2014 i the person is or has been a promoter in relation to the arrangements, or ii that would be the case if the condition in sub-paragraph (2) were met. 2 That condition is that the definition of  \u201ctax\u201d in section 283 includes, and has always included, value added tax. Relevant defeat of single arrangements 4 1 A defeat of arrangements (entered into by any person) which are promoted arrangements in relation to a person (\u201cthe promoter\u201d) is a  \u201c relevant defeat \u201d in relation to the promoter if the condition in sub-paragraph (2) is met. 2 The condition is that the arrangements are not related to any other arrangements which are promoted arrangements in relation to the promoter. 3 For the meaning of  \u201cdefeat\u201d see paragraphs 10 to 16. Relevant defeat of related arrangements 5 1 This paragraph applies if arrangements (entered into by any person) (\u201cSet A\u201d)\u2014 a are promoted arrangements in relation to a person (\u201cP\u201d), and b are related to other arrangements which are promoted arrangements in relation to P. 2 If Case 1, 2 or 3 applies (see paragraphs 7 to 9) a relevant defeat occurs in relation to P and each of the related arrangements. 3 \u201c The related arrangements \u201d means Set A and the arrangements mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b). Limit on number of separate relevant defeats in relation to the same, or related, arrangements 6 In relation to a person, if there has been a relevant defeat of arrangements (whether under paragraph 4 or 5) there cannot be a further relevant defeat of\u2014 a those particular arrangements, or b arrangements which are related to those arrangements. Case 1: counteraction upheld by judicial ruling 7 1 Case 1 applies if\u2014 a any of Conditions A to E is met in relation to any of the related arrangements, and b in the case of those arrangements the decision to make the relevant counteraction has been upheld by a judicial ruling (which is final). 2 In sub-paragraph (1)  \u201c the relevant counteraction \u201d means the counteraction mentioned in paragraph 11(d), 12(1)(b), 13(1)(d), 14(1)(d) or 15(1)(d) (as the case requires). Case 2: judicial ruling that avoidance-related rule applies 8 Case 2 applies if Condition F is met in relation to any of the related arrangements. Case 3: proportion-based relevant defeat 9 1 Case 3 applies if\u2014 a at least 75% of the tested arrangements have been defeated, and b no final judicial ruling in relation to any of the related arrangements has upheld a corresponding tax advantage which has been asserted in connection with any of the related arrangements. 2 In this paragraph  \u201c the tested arrangements \u201d means so many of the related arrangements (as defined in paragraph 5(3)) as meet the condition in sub-paragraph (3) or (4). 3 Particular arrangements meet this condition if a person has made a return, claim or election on the basis that a tax advantage results from those arrangements and\u2014 a there has been an enquiry or investigation by HMRC into the return, claim or election, or b HMRC assesses the person to tax on the basis that the tax advantage (or any part of it) does not arise, or c a GAAR counteraction notice has been given in relation to the tax advantage or part of it and the arrangements. 4 Particular arrangements meet this condition if HMRC takes other action on the basis that a tax advantage which might be expected to arise from those arrangements, or is asserted in connection with them, does not arise. 5 For the purposes of this paragraph a tax advantage has been  \u201casserted\u201d in connection with particular arrangements if a person has made a return, claim or election on the basis that the tax advantage arises from those arrangements. 6 In sub-paragraph (1)(b)  \u201c corresponding tax advantage \u201d means a tax advantage corresponding to any tax advantage the counteraction of which is taken into account by HMRC for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(a). 7 For the purposes of this paragraph a court or tribunal  \u201cupholds\u201d a tax advantage if\u2014 a the court or tribunal makes a ruling to the effect that no part of the tax advantage is to be counteracted, and b that judicial ruling is final. 8 In this paragraph references to  \u201ccounteraction\u201d include anything referred to as a counteraction in any of Conditions A to F in paragraphs 11 to 16. 9 In this paragraph  \u201c GAAR counteraction notice \u201d means\u2014 a a notice such as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 12 of Schedule 43 to FA 2013 (notice of final decision to counteract), b a notice under paragraph 8(2) or 9(2) of Schedule 43A to that Act (pooling or binding of arrangements) stating that the tax advantage is to be counteracted under the general anti-abuse rule, or c a notice under paragraph 8(2) of Schedule 43B to that Act (generic referrals) stating that the tax advantage is to be counteracted under the general anti-abuse rule.                                 \u201cDefeat\u201d of arrangements 10 For the purposes of this Part of this Act a  \u201cdefeat\u201d of arrangements occurs if any of Conditions A to F (in paragraphs 11 to 16) is met in relation to the arrangements. 11 Condition A is that\u2014 a a person has made a return, claim or election on the basis that a tax advantage arises from the arrangements, b a notice given to the person under paragraph 12 of Schedule 43 to, paragraph 8(2) or 9(2) of Schedule 43A to or paragraph 8(2) of Schedule 43B to FA 2013 stated that the tax advantage was to be counteracted under the general anti-abuse rule, c the tax advantage has been counteracted (in whole or in part) under the general anti-abuse rule, and d the counteraction is final. 12 1 Condition B is that a follower notice has been given to a person by reference to the arrangements (and not withdrawn) and\u2014 a the person has complied with subsection (2) of section 208 of FA 2014 by taking the action specified in subsections (4) to (6) of that section in respect of the denied tax advantage (or part of it), or b the denied tax advantage has been counteracted (in whole or in part) otherwise than as mentioned in paragraph (a) and the counteraction is final. 2 In this paragraph  \u201cthe denied tax advantage\u201d is to be interpreted in accordance with section 208(3) of FA 2014. 3 In this Schedule  \u201c follower notice \u201d means a follower notice under Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 2014. 13 1 Condition C is that\u2014 a the arrangements are DOTAS arrangements, b a person (\u201cthe taxpayer\u201d) has made a return, claim or election on the basis that a relevant tax advantage arises, c the relevant tax advantage has been counteracted, and d the counteraction is final. 2 For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)  \u201c relevant tax advantage \u201d means a tax advantage which the arrangements might be expected to enable the taxpayer to obtain. 3 For the purposes of this paragraph the relevant tax advantage is  \u201ccounteracted\u201d if adjustments are made in respect of the taxpayer's tax position on the basis that the whole or part of that tax advantage does not arise. 14 1 Condition D is that\u2014 a the arrangements are disclosable VAT arrangements to which a taxable person is a party, b the taxable person has made a return or claim on the basis that a relevant tax advantage arises, c the relevant tax advantage has been counteracted, and d the counteraction is final. 2 For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)  \u201c relevant tax advantage \u201d means a tax advantage which the arrangements might be expected to enable the taxable person to obtain. 3 For the purposes of this paragraph the relevant tax advantage is  \u201ccounteracted\u201d if adjustments are made in respect of the taxable person's tax position on the basis that the whole or part of that tax advantage does not arise. 15 1 Condition E is that the arrangements are disclosable VAT arrangements to which a taxable person (\u201cT\u201d) is a party and\u2014 a the arrangements relate to the position with respect to VAT of a person other than T (\u201cS\u201d) who has made supplies of goods or services to T, b the arrangements might be expected to enable T to obtain a tax advantage in connection with those supplies of goods or services, c the arrangements have been counteracted, and d the counteraction is final. 2 For the purposes of this paragraph the arrangements are  \u201ccounteracted\u201d if\u2014 a HMRC assess S to tax or take any other action on a basis which prevents T from obtaining (or obtaining the whole of) the tax advantage in question, or b adjustments are made on a basis such as is mentioned in paragraph (a). 16 1 Condition F is that\u2014 a a person has made a return, claim or election on the basis that a relevant tax advantage arises, b the tax advantage, or part of the tax advantage would not arise if a particular avoidance-related rule (see paragraph 25) applies in relation to the person's tax affairs, c it is

relevant tax advantage \u201d means a tax advantage which the arrangements might be expected to enable the person to obtain.  PART 3  Relevant defeats: associated persons Attribution of relevant defeats 17 1 Sub-paragraph (2) applies if\u2014 a there is (or has been) a person (\u201cQ\u201d), b arrangements (\u201cthe defeated arrangements\u201d) have been entered into, c an event occurs such that either\u2014 i there is a relevant defeat in relation to Q and the defeated arrangements, or ii the condition in sub-paragraph (i) would be met if Q had not ceased to exist, d at the time of that event a person (\u201cP\u201d) is carrying on a business as a promoter (or is carrying on what would be such a business under the condition in paragraph 3(2)), and e Condition 1 or 2 is met in relation to Q and P. 2 The event is treated for all purposes of this Part of this Act as a relevant defeat in relation to P and the defeated arrangements (whether or not it is also a relevant defeat in relation to Q, and regardless of whether or not P existed at any time when those arrangements were promoted arrangements in relation to Q). 3 Condition 1 is that\u2014 a P is not an individual, b at a time when the defeated arrangements were promoted arrangements in relation to Q\u2014 i P was a relevant body controlled by Q, or ii Q was a relevant body controlled by P, and c at the time of the event mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(c)\u2014 i Q is a relevant body controlled by P, ii P is a relevant body controlled by Q, or iii P and Q are relevant bodies controlled by a third person. 4 Condition 2 is that\u2014 a P and Q are relevant bodies, b at a time when the defeated arrangements were promoted arrangements in relation to Q, a third person (\u201cC\u201d) controlled Q, and c C controls P at the time of the event mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(c). 5 For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (3)(b) and (4)(b), the question whether arrangements are promoted arrangements in relation to Q at any time is to be determined on the assumption that the reference to  \u201cdesign\u201d in paragraph (b) of section 235(3) (definition of  \u201c promoter \u201d in relation to relevant arrangements) is omitted. Deemed defeat notices 18 1 This paragraph applies if\u2014 a an authorised officer becomes aware at any time (\u201c the relevant time \u201d) that a relevant defeat has occurred in relation to a person (  \u201c                                        P                                      \u201d ) who is carrying on a business as a promoter, b there have occurred, more than 3 years before the relevant time\u2014 i one third party defeat, or ii two third party defeats, and c conditions A1 and B1 (in a case within paragraph (b)(i)), or conditions A2 and B2 (in a case within paragraph (b)(ii)), are met. 2 Where this paragraph applies by virtue of sub-paragraph (1)(b)(i), this Part of this Act has effect as if an authorised officer had (with due authority), at the time of the time of the third party defeat, given P a single defeat notice under section 241A(2) in respect of it. 3 Where this paragraph applies by virtue of sub-paragraph (1)(b)(ii), this Part of this Act has effect as if an authorised officer had (with due authority), at the time of the second of the two third party defeats, given P a double defeat notice under section 241A(3) in respect of the two third party defeats. 4 Section 241A(8) has no effect in relation to a notice treated as given as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) or (3). 5 Condition A1 is that\u2014 a a conduct notice or a single or double defeat notice has been given to the other person (see sub-paragraph (9)) in respect of the third party defeat, b at the time of the third party defeat an authorised officer would have had power by virtue of paragraph 17 to give P a defeat notice in respect of the third party defeat, had the officer been aware that it was a relevant defeat in relation to P, and c so far as the authorised officer mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a) is aware, the conditions for giving P a defeat notice in respect of the third party defeat have never been met (ignoring this paragraph). 6 Condition A2 is that\u2014 a a conduct notice or a single or double defeat notice has been given to the other person (see sub-paragraph (9)) in respect of each, or both, of the third party defeats, b at the time of the second third party defeat an authorised officer would have had power by virtue of paragraph 17 to give P a double defeat notice in respect of the third party defeats, had the officer been aware that either of the third party defeats was a relevant defeat in relation to P, and c so far as the authorised officer mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a) is aware, the conditions for giving P a defeat notice in respect of those third party defeats (or either of them) have never been met (ignoring this paragraph). 7 Condition B1 is that, had an authorised officer given P a defeat notice in respect of the third party defeat at the time of that relevant defeat, that defeat notice would still have effect at the relevant time (see sub-paragraph (1)). 8 Condition B2 is that, had an authorised officer given P a defeat notice in respect of the two third party defeats at the time of the second of those relevant defeats, that defeat notice would still have effect at the relevant time. 9 In this paragraph  \u201c third party defeat \u201d means a relevant defeat which has occurred in relation to a person other than P. Meaning of  \u201crelevant body\u201d and  \u201ccontrol\u201d 19 1 In this Part of this Schedule  \u201c relevant body \u201d means\u2014 a a body corporate, or b a partnership. 2 For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule a person controls a body corporate if the person has power to secure that the affairs of the body corporate are conducted in accordance with the person's wishes\u2014 a by means of the holding of shares or the possession of voting power in relation to the body corporate or any other relevant body, b as a result of any powers conferred by the articles of association or other document regulating the body corporate or any other relevant body, or c by means of controlling a partnership. 3 For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule a person controls a partnership if the person is a controlling member or the managing partner of the partnership. 4 In this paragraph  \u201c controlling member \u201d has the same meaning as in Schedule 36 (partnerships). 5 In this paragraph  \u201c managing partner \u201d, in relation to a partnership, means the member of the partnership who directs, or is on a day-to-day level in control of, the management of the business of the partnership.  PART 4  Meeting section 237A conditions: bodies corporate and partnerships Treating persons under another's control as meeting section 237A condition 20 1 A relevant body (\u201cRB\u201d) is treated as meeting a section 237A condition at the section 237A(2) relevant time if\u2014 a that condition was met by a person (\u201cC\u201d) at a time when\u2014 i C was carrying on a business as a promoter, or ii RB was carrying on a business as a promoter and C controlled RB, and b RB is controlled by C at the section 237A(2) relevant time. 2 Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply if C is an individual. 3 For the purposes of determining whether the requirements of sub-paragraph (1) are met by reason of meeting the requirement in sub-paragraph (1)(a)(i), it does not matter whether RB existed at the time when C met the section 237A condition. Treating persons in control of others as meeting section 237A condition 21 1 A person other than an individual is treated as meeting a section 237A condition at the section 237A(2) relevant time if\u2014 a a relevant body (\u201cA\u201d) met the condition at a time when A was controlled by the person, and b at the time mentioned in paragraph (a) A, or another relevant body (\u201cB\u201d) which was also at that time controlled by the person, carried on a business as a promoter. 2 For the purposes of determining whether the requirements of sub-paragraph (1) are met it does not matter whether A or B (or neither) exists at the section 237A(2) relevant time. Treating persons controlled by the same person as meeting section 237A condition 22 1 A relevant body (\u201cRB\u201d) is treated as meeting a section 237A condition at the section 237A(2) relevant time if\u2014 a another relevant body met that condition at a time (\u201ctime T\u201d) when it was controlled by a person (\u201cC\u201d), b at time T, there was a relevant body controlled by C which carried on a business as a promoter, and c RB is controlled by C at the section 237A(2) relevant time. 2 For the purposes of determining whether the requirements of sub-paragraph (1) are met it does not matter whether\u2014 a RB existed at time T, or b any relevant body (other than RB) by reason of which the requirements of sub-paragraph (1) are met exists at the section 237A(2) relevant time. Interpretation 23 1 In this Part of this Schedule\u2014 \u201c control \u201d has the same meaning as in Part 3 of this Schedule; \u201c relevant body \u201d has the same meaning as in Part 3 of this Schedule; \u201c section 237A(2) relevant time \u201d means the time referred to in section 237A(2); \u201c section 237A condition \u201d means any of the conditions in section 237A(11), (12) and (13). 2 For the purposes of paragraphs 20(1)(a), 21(1)(a) and 22(1)(a), the condition in section 237A(11) (occurrence of 3 relevant defeats in the 3 years ending with the relevant time) is taken to have been met by a person at any time if at least 3 relevant defeats have occurred in relation to the person in the period of 3 years ending with that time.  PART 5  Supplementary                                 \u201cAdjustments\u201d                               24 In this Schedule  \u201c adjustments \u201d means any adjustments, whether by way of an assessment, the modification of an assessment or return, the amendment or disallowance of a claim, the entering into of a contract settlement or otherwise (and references to  \u201cmaking\u201d adjustments accordingly include securing that adjustments are made by entering into a contract settlement). Meaning of  \u201cavoidance-related rule\u201d 25 1 In this Schedule  \u201c avoidance-related rule \u201d means a rule in Category 1 or 2. 2 A rule is in Category 1 if\u2014 a it refers (in whatever terms) to the purpose or main purpose or purposes of a transaction, arrangements or any other action or matter, and b to whether or not the purpose in question is or involves the avoidance of tax or the obtaining of any advantage in relation to tax (however described). 3 A rule is also in Category 1 if it refers (in whatever terms) to\u2014 a expectations as to what are, or may be, the expected benefits of a transaction, arrangements or any other action or matter, and b whether or not the avoidance of tax or the obtaining of any advantage in relation to tax (however described) is such a benefit. For the purposes of paragraph (b) it does not matter whether the reference is (for instance) to the  \u201csole or main benefit\u201d or  \u201cone of the main benefits\u201d or any other reference to a benefit. 4 A rule falls within Category 2 if as a result of the rule a person may be treated differently for tax purposes depending on whether or not purposes referred to in the rule (for instance the purposes of an actual or contemplated action or enterprise) are (or are shown to be) commercial purposes. 5 For example, a rule in the following form would fall within Category 1 and within Category 2\u2014 Example rule Section X does not apply to a company in respect of a transaction if the company shows that the transaction meets Condition A or B. Condition A is that the transaction is effected\u2014 a for genuine commercial reasons, or b in the ordinary course of managing investments. Condition B is that the avoidance of tax is not the main object or one of the main objects of the transaction.                                 \u201cDOTAS arrangements\u201d                               26 1 For the purposes of this Schedule arrangements are  \u201cDOTAS arrangements\u201d at any time if at that time a person\u2014 a has provided, information in relation to the arrangements under section 308(3), 309 or 310 of FA 2004, or b has failed to comply with any of those provisions in relation to the arrangements. 2 But for the purposes of this Schedule  \u201c DOTAS arrangements \u201d does not include arrangements in respect of which HMRC has given notice under section 312(6) of FA 2004 (notice that promoters not under duty to notify client of reference number). 3 For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) a person who would be required to provide information under subsection (3) of section 308 of FA 2004\u2014 a but for the fact that the arrangements implement a proposal in respect of which notice has been given under subsection (1) of that section, or b but for subsection (4A), (4C) or (5) of that section, is treated as providing the information at the end of the period referred to in subsection (3) of that section.                                 \u201cDisclosable VAT arrangements\u201d                               27 For the purposes of this Schedule arrangements are  \u201cdisclosable VAT arrangements\u201d at any time if at that time\u2014 a a person has complied with paragraph 6 of Schedule 11A to VATA 1994 in relation to the arrangements (duty to notify Commissioners), b a person under a duty to comply with that paragraph in relation to the arrangements has failed to do so, or c a reference number has been allocated to the scheme under paragraph 9 of that Schedule (voluntary notification of avoidance scheme which is not a designated scheme).
