Duration of disqualification, and suspension pending disqualification 181B 1 An order under section 181A must specify the period for which the person is disqualified. 2 The period\u2014 a must be not more than 15 years beginning with the day on which the order takes effect, and b must be proportionate, having regard in particular to the time when a conviction becomes spent or, where condition B applies, would become spent if it were a conviction for the relevant disqualifying offence, and to circumstances in which the Commission may or must grant a waiver under section 181 where a person is disqualified under section 178. 3 An order takes effect\u2014 a at the end of the time specified by Tribunal Procedure Rules for starting proceedings for an appeal against the order, if no proceedings are started within that time, or b (subject to the decision on the appeal) when any proceedings started within that time are withdrawn or finally determined. 4 The Commission may by order suspend a person from being a charity trustee or trustee for a charity if it has given notice under section 181C(1)(a) of its proposal to make an order under section 181A in respect of the person. 5 The Commission may not make an order under subsection (4) so as to suspend a person for a period of more than 12 months, but at any time before the expiry of an order the Commission may extend or further extend the suspension by a further order under that subsection, provided that\u2014 a the order does not extend the suspension for a period of more than 12 months, and b the total period of suspension is not more than 2 years. 6 An order under subsection (4) ceases to have effect\u2014 a if the Commission notifies the person that it will not proceed with its proposal, on the notification being given; b if the Commission makes the order under section 181A, on the order taking effect; or, if earlier, at the end of the period specified in accordance with subsection (5). 7 The Commission must review any order under subsection (4), at such intervals as it thinks fit. 8 If on a review it appears to the Commission that it would be appropriate to discharge an order under subsection (4) in whole or in part, the Commission must do so (whether subject to any savings or other transitional provisions or not). 9 An order under subsection (4) made in the case of any person (\u201cP\u201d) may make provision, as respects the period of P's suspension, for matters arising out of it, and in particular\u2014 a for enabling any person to execute any instrument in P's name or otherwise act for P, and b in the case of a charity trustee, for adjusting any rules governing the proceedings of the charity trustees to take account of the reduction in the number capable of acting. This does not affect the generality of section 337(1) and (2). 10 While an order under subsection (4) is in force suspending a person from being a charity trustee or trustee for a charity, the person must not take up any appointment as a charity trustee or trustee for any other charity without the written approval of the Commission. Disqualification orders: procedure 181C 1 Before making an order in respect of a person under section 181A without the person's consent the Commission must\u2014 a give the person not less than one month's notice of its proposals, and b invite representations to be made to it within a period specified in the notice. 2 Before making an order under section 181A in respect of a person who the Commission knows or believes to be a charity trustee or trustee for a charity, the Commission must also\u2014 a give notice of its proposals to each of the charity trustees of the charity in question; b comply with the publicity requirement, unless the Commission is satisfied that for any reason compliance with the requirement is unnecessary. 3 The publicity requirement is that the Commission must give public notice of its proposals, inviting representations to be made to it within a period specified in the notice. 4 The time when any such notice is given is to be decided by the Commission. 5 Any notice of any proposals which is to be given under this section is to contain such particulars of the proposals, or such directions for obtaining information about them, as the Commission thinks sufficient and appropriate. 6 Where the Commission gives notice of any proposals under this section\u2014 a it must take into account any representations made to it within the period specified in the notice, and b it may (without further notice) proceed with the proposals either without modifications or with such modifications as it thinks desirable; but a notice under subsection (2)(a) need not specify a period for the purposes of paragraph (a) if the charity came to the Commission's knowledge or belief after the expiry of the period specified for the purposes of subsection (1)(b). 7 A notice under subsection (1) or (2)(a)\u2014 a may be given by post, and b if given by post, may be addressed to the recipient's last known address in the United Kingdom. 8 A notice under subsection (2)(b) is to be given in such manner as the Commission thinks sufficient and appropriate. 9 Where the Commission makes an order under section 181A in respect of a person it knows or believes to be a charity trustee or trustee for a charity it must (as well as serving it on that person) send a copy of the order and a statement of the Commission's reasons for making it\u2014 a to the charity in question (if a body corporate), or b (if not) to each of the charity trustees of the charity in question. 10 Nothing in this section requires the Commission to give notice, or send a document, to a person who cannot be found or has no known address in the United Kingdom. 11 Any documents required to be sent to a person under this section may be sent to, or otherwise served on, the person in the same way as an order made by the Commission under this Act could be served on the person in accordance with section 339. Disqualification orders: variation and revocation 181D A person in respect of whom an order under section 181A is in force may at any time apply to the Commission for an order varying or discharging that order. 3 In section 183 (criminal consequences of acting while disqualified)\u2014 a in subsection (1), after  \u201csection 178\u201d insert  \u201c                    or an order under section 181A                  \u201d ; b in subsection (2)(b), after  \u201cG\u201d insert  \u201c                    in section 178                  \u201d . 4 In section 184 (civil consequences of acting while disqualified)\u2014 a in subsection (1), after  \u201csection 178\u201d insert  \u201c                    or an order under section 181A                  \u201d ; b in subsection (2)(a), after  \u201csection 178\u201d insert  \u201c                    or an order under section 181A.                  \u201d 5 Section 348 (regulations subject to affirmative procedure etc) is amended as follows. 6 In subsection (1), before paragraph (c) insert\u2014 ba regulations under section 181A(8) (conditions for disqualification by order); . 7 In subsection (2) before  \u201cor (c)\u201d insert  \u201c                , (bb)              \u201d . 8 In subsection (4) before paragraph (a) insert\u2014 zb section 181A(8), if the regulations add a condition, . 9 In Schedule 6 (appeals and applications to tribunal), after the entry relating to a decision of the Commission under section 181(2) to waive, or not waive, a person's disqualification insert\u2014 Order made by the Commission under section 181A.

and b achieving a financial return for the charity. 3 References to an act of a charity are, in the case of an unincorporated charity, to an act of the charity trustees. 4 A relevant act of a charity is\u2014 a an application or use of funds or other property; or b taking on a commitment in relation to a liability of another person (such as a guarantee) that puts the charity's funds or other property at risk of being applied or used. 5 An act mentioned in subsection (4)(a) is to be regarded as achieving a financial return if its outcome is better for the charity in financial terms than expending the whole of the funds or other property in question. 6 A commitment mentioned in subsection (4)(b) is to be regarded as achieving a financial return if\u2014 a it is not called upon;
