to retain and examine, the bulk personal dataset only if authorised to do so by a class BPD warrant or a specific BPD warrant under this Part. 5 A direction under subsection (3) may provide for any associated regulatory provision specified in the direction to continue to apply in relation to the bulk personal dataset, with or without modifications specified in the direction. 6 The power

continue to apply in relation to it with the modification that the reference in section 58(7)(a) to the provisions of Part 2 is to be read as including a reference to the provisions of this Part. 7 The Secretary of State may only give a direction under subsection (3) with the approval of a Judicial Commissioner. 8 In deciding whether to give approval for the purposes of subsection (7), the Judicial Commissioner must apply the same principles as would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review. 9 Where a Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve a decision by the Secretary of State to give a direction under subsection (3), the Judicial Commissioner must give the Secretary of State written reasons for the decision. 10 Where a Judicial Commissioner, other than the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, refuses to approve such a decision, the Secretary of State may ask the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to decide whether to approve the decision. 11 A direction under subsection (3)\u2014 a may not be revoked; b may be varied but only for the purpose of altering or removing any provision included in the direction under subsection (5). 12 Subsections (7) to (10) apply in relation to the variation of a direction under subsection (3) as they apply in relation to the giving of a direction under that subsection. 13 The head of an intelligence service may, at the same time as applying for a direction under subsection (3), apply for a specific BPD warrant under section 205 (and the Secretary of State may issue such a warrant at the same time as giving the direction). 14 In this section,  \u201c associated regulatory provision \u201d, in relation to a power of an intelligence service to retain or examine a bulk personal dataset, means any provision which\u2014 a is made by or for the purposes of this Act (other than this Part), and b applied in relation to the retention, examination, disclosure or other use of the bulk personal dataset
