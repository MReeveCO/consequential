and b arrangements have been made for the union to make reasonable payments to the employer in respect of the making of the deductions. 2 Payments are  \u201c reasonable \u201d for the purposes of subsection (1) if the employer is satisfied that the total amount of the payments is substantially equivalent to the total cost to public funds of making the deductions. 3 An employer is a relevant public sector employer if the employer is a public authority specified, or of a description specified, in regulations made by a Minister of the Crown. 4 A Minister of the Crown may by regulations provide, in relation to a body or other person that is not a public authority but has functions of a public nature and is funded wholly or mainly from public funds, that the body or other person is to be treated as a public authority for the purposes of this section. 5 Regulations under this section may make provision specifying the person or other entity that is to be treated for the purposes of this section as the employer of a person who is employed by the Crown. 6 The regulations may\u2014 a deem a category of persons holding an office or employment under the Crown (or two or more such categories taken together) to be an entity for the purposes of provision made under subsection (5); b make different provision under subsection (5) for different categories of persons holding an office or employment under the Crown. 7 Regulations under this section may\u2014 a make different provision for different purposes; b make transitional provision in connection with the coming into force of any provision of the regulations; c make consequential provision amending or otherwise modifying contracts of employment or collective agreements. 8 Regulations under this section are to be made by statutory instrument. 9 A statutory instrument containing regulations under this section may not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament. 10 In this section\u2014 \u201c trade union subscriptions \u201d means payments to a trade union in respect of a worker's membership of the union; \u201c wages \u201d has the

thinks fit, b must give the union an opportunity to make written representations, and c may give the union an opportunity to make oral representations. 3 If the Certification Officer makes a declaration it must specify the provisions with which the union has failed to comply. 4 Where the Certification Officer makes a declaration and is satisfied\u2014 a that steps have been taken by the union with a view to remedying the declared failure or securing that a failure of the same or any similar kind does not occur in future, or b that the union has agreed to take such steps, the Officer
