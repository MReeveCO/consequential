or b a certificate granted under section 20 of that Act (masters\u2019 and first mates\u2019 pilotage certificates) was in force in respect of the district at any time in any of those years in respect of which information was so given. 3 If the Secretary of State considers that in the interests of efficiency and safety of navigation a competent harbour authority should exercise pilotage functions both as respects its harbour and another area, he may by order provide\u2014 a that this Act shall apply to that authority as if its harbour included that other area; and b in a case where the other area is or falls within the harbour of another competent harbour authority, that that other authority shall not be a competent harbour authority for the purposes of this Act. 4 A harbour authority which is not a competent harbour authority may apply to the Secretary of State to be treated for the purposes of this Act as such an authority and on such an application the Secretary of State may by order provide that the applicant shall be a competent harbour authority for the purposes of this Act. 4A A harbour authority in England or Wales is not a competent harbour authority for the purposes of this Act while it is specified in an order of the Secretary of State under this subsection. 4B A harbour authority in Scotland is not a competent harbour authority for the purposes of this Act while it is specified in an order of the Scottish Ministers under this subsection. 5 An order under this section may be amended or revoked by further order. 6 The Secretary of State shall maintain a list of the authorities which are for the time being competent harbour authorities for the purposes of this Act. 7 Before making an order under  subsection (3) or (4)  the Secretary of State shall inform the persons he considers may be affected by the order of the terms of the proposed order and that they may within such reasonable period as he may specify object to the making of the order by giving him notice in writing. 8  Where any person has duly objected under subsection (7) above to the making of a proposed order and has not withdrawn his objection, then if the Secretary of State makes an order in that form (or a substantially similar form) it shall be subject to special parliamentary procedure, and the  Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act 1945 shall have effect accordingly, but as if\u2014 a sections 2 and 10(2) of that Act (which relate to preliminary proceedings) were omitted;
