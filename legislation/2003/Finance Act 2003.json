This subsection is subject to subsections (4) to (6) below. 4 The amount or value of any consideration is not to be regarded as being unascertainable by reason only\u2014 a that the right to receive the whole or any part of the consideration is postponed or contingent, if the consideration or, as the case may be, that part of it is, in accordance with section 48, brought into account in the computation of the gain accruing to the taxpayer on the disposal of an asset, or b in a case where the right to receive the whole or any part of the consideration is postponed and is to be, or may be, to any extent satisfied by the receipt of property of one description or property of some other description, that some person has a right to select the property, or the description of property, that is to be received. 5 A right is not to be taken to be a right to unascertainable consideration by reason only that either the amount or the value of the consideration has not been fixed, if\u2014 a the amount will be fixed by reference to the value, and the value is ascertainable, or b the value will be fixed by reference to the amount, and the amount is ascertainable. 6 A right which is by virtue of subsection (2) or (4) of section 138A (use of earn-out rights for exchange of securities) assumed in accordance with subsection (3)(a) of that section to be a security, within the definition in section 132, is not to be regarded as a right to unascertainable consideration. 7 For the purposes of section 279A, any question as to\u2014 a whether a chargeable gain or a loss is one that accrues (or would, apart from any particular provision, accrue) on a particular disposal or a disposal of any particular description, or b the time at which, or year in which, any particular disposal takes place, is to be determined without regard to section 10A(2)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(chargeable gains and losses accruing during temporary non-residence to be treated as accruing in year of return). This subsection is subject to subsection (8) below. 8 Subsection (7) above does not affect the determination of any question\u2014 a as to the year in which the chargeable gain or loss is, by virtue of section 10A(2), to be treated as accruing (apart from section 279C), or b where (apart from section 279C) a loss is to be treated by virtue of section 10A(2) as accruing in a particular year, whether the loss is an allowable loss. Effect of election under section 279A 279C 1 This section applies where an election is made under section 279A by the taxpayer for the relevant loss to be treated as accruing in an earlier year in accordance with this section. 2 Where this section applies, the relevant loss shall be treated for the purposes of capital gains tax as if it were a loss accruing to the taxpayer in the earliest year which is an eligible year (the  \u201c first eligible year \u201d), instead of in the year of the loss (but subject to, and in accordance with, the following provisions of this section). 3 The amount of the relevant loss that falls to be deducted from chargeable gains of the first eligible year in accordance with section 2(2)(a) is limited to the amount (the  \u201c first year limit \u201d) found by taking the following steps\u2014 Step 1:  take the total amount of chargeable gains accruing to the taxpayer in the first eligible year, Step 2:  exclude from that amount any amounts that fall to be disregarded in accordance with section 2(4)(a) for that year, Step 3:  deduct from the amount remaining any amounts in respect of allowable losses (other than the relevant loss or any part of it) that fall to be deducted from that amount in accordance with section 2(2) otherwise than by virtue of section 2(5)(aa)(i)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(taking account of any previous elections under section 279A). The amount so found is the first year limit, unless the first eligible year is a year in relation to which section 2(5)(aa) has effect, in which case the further steps in subsection (4) below must also be taken. 4 Those further steps are\u2014 Step 4:  add to the amount found by taking steps 1 to 3 in subsection (3) above every amount which is treated by virtue of section 77 or 86 as an amount of chargeable gains accruing to the taxpayer for the first eligible year (the  \u201c attributed amounts \u201d), Step 5:  deduct from the resulting amount any amounts (other than the relevant loss or any part of it) that fall to be deducted from the attributed amounts in accordance with section 2(5)(aa)(i)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(taking account of any previous elections under section 279A). The amount so found is the first year limit in a case where section 2(5)(aa) applies in relation to the first eligible year. 5 As respects any later year before the year of the loss, the relevant loss (so far as not previously allowed as a deduction from chargeable gains accruing in any previous year) falls to be deducted in accordance with section 2(2)(b) only if that later year is an eligible year. 6 The amount of the relevant loss that falls to be deducted from chargeable gains of that later eligible year in accordance with section 2(2)(b) is limited to the amount (the  \u201c later year limit \u201d) in respect of which the taxpayer would be chargeable to capital gains tax for that later year\u2014 a on the assumption in subsection (7) below, b taking account of any previous elections under section 279A, and c apart from the provisions specified in subsection (8) below. 7 The assumption is that no part of\u2014 a the relevant loss, or b any loss in respect of which an election under section 279A may be, but has not been, made, falls to be deducted, in consequence of an election under section 279A, from any chargeable gains accruing to the taxpayer in that later eligible year. The assumption falls to be made immediately after the making of the election in respect of the relevant loss. 8 The provisions are\u2014 a section 2(5)(a)(ii)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(taper relief), b section 2(5)(aa)(ii)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(taper relief), c section 2(5)(b)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(addition of certain amounts treated as amounts of chargeable gains), and d section 2A (taper relief), except that paragraphs (b) and (d) above are not to affect the operation of section 2(7) for the purposes of subsection (6) above. 9 All such adjustments shall be made, whether by discharge or repayment of tax, the making of assessments or otherwise, as are required to give effect to the election under section 279A made by the taxpayer for the relevant loss to be treated as accruing in an earlier year in accordance with this section. 10 Any reference in this section or section 279D to deduction in accordance with section 2(2)(a), section 2(2)(b) or section 2(2) includes a reference to such deduction by virtue of section 2(5)(a)(i) or (aa)(i).

For this purpose, losses that would, apart from that amendment, be treated by virtue of section 10A of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 as accruing in the year 2003-04 shall be treated as so

subsection (2) or, as the case may be, (7) of section 150 of the Finance Act 1994 (c. 9) as the amounts of the currency to be received, and the currency to be paid in exchange, under the qualifying contract as mentioned in that subsection. 4 Where this section first applies in relation to the qualifying contract in an accounting period of the company which begins before 1st October 2002 (\u201c the relevant contract period \u201d), the following provisions of the Finance Act 2002 (c. 23), namely\u2014 a section 79(1)(b)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(repeal of forex), b section 80 and Schedule 24 (corporation tax: currency), and c section 83 and Schedules 26 and 27 (derivative contracts), shall be taken to have effect in the case of the company, so far as relating to that contract, in relation to that accounting period and any subsequent accounting periods. 4A In relation to a subsequent accounting period ending on or after 1 April 2009, the reference in subsection (4)(c) to Schedule 26 is to be read as a reference to Part 7 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009. 5 Where\u2014 a the qualifying contract is a currency contract which arises from the exercise of a currency option which is or was itself a qualifying contract (or a series of such currency options), and b that currency option was entered into or varied on or after 30th September 2002 (or, in the case of a series of currency options, any of them was entered into or varied on or after that date), the provisions specified in subsection (4) shall be taken to have effect in the case of the company, so far as relating to the currency option (or, in the case of a series of currency options, each of the options entered into or varied on or after 30th September 2002), in relation to the earliest accounting period (\u201c the relevant options period \u201d) in which the option (or any of the options) was so entered into or varied and any subsequent accounting periods. 6 Where the provisions specified in subsection (4) have effect by virtue of this section in relation to a currency contract or currency option the following provisions of the Finance Act 2002, namely\u2014 a section 81 (transitional provision), so far as relating to section 80 and Schedule 24, and b Schedule 28 (derivative contracts: transitional provisions etc), shall have effect accordingly. 7 In the application of Schedule 28 to the Finance Act 2002 by virtue of this section, any reference to the company\u2019s commencement day is to be taken\u2014 a in the case of a currency contract, as a reference to the first day of the relevant contract period; or b in the case of a currency option, as a reference to the first day of the relevant options period. 8 This section does not apply in relation to any contract entered into or varied in an accounting period beginning on or after 1st October 2002 unless the contract arises from the exercise of a currency option which was entered into or varied on or after 30th September 2002 and in an accounting period beginning on or before that date. 9 In this section the following expressions, namely\u2014 a qualifying company, b qualifying contract, c currency contract, d currency option, have the same meaning as in Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the Finance Act 1994 (c. 9), (disregarding for this purpose the provisions specified in subsection (4)) and references to the exercise of an option shall be construed accordingly. 10 In this section  \u201c statutory accounts \u201d has the meaning given by paragraph 52 of Schedule 26 to the Finance Act 2002 (c. 23). 11 This section shall be deemed to

virtue of the acquisition or holding of any of those shares or its being entered in the company\u2019s register of members in respect of any of them, to be treated as a member of itself. 4 Subject to subsection (5)\u2014 a the company\u2019s issued share capital is to be treated as if it had been reduced by the nominal value of the shares acquired, b such of those shares as are not cancelled on acquisition are to be treated as if they had been so cancelled, and c any subsequent cancellation by the company of any of those shares is to be disregarded (and, accordingly, is not the disposal of an asset and does not give rise to an allowable loss within the meaning of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (c. 12)). 5 Where the shares are issued to the company as bonus shares, subsection

holding of shares for the purposes of the application of section 126 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (application of sections 127 to 131 of that Act (company reorganisations etc)). 7 In subsection (6) the reference to the application of section 126 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 does not include a reference to the application of that section in a modified form by virtue of any enactment relating to chargeable gains. 8 Where a company disposes of any of its own shares to a person in circumstances where, but for subsections (2) to (5), it would be regarded as holding

treated as having subscribed for the relevant shares, d an amount equal to the amount or value of the consideration (if any) payable for the disposal of the relevant shares is to be treated as the amount subscribed for those shares, e if the amount or value of that consideration does not exceed the nominal value of those shares, the share capital of those shares is to be treated for the purposes of   Part 23 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010   as if it were an amount equal to the amount or value of that consideration, and f if the amount or value of that consideration exceeds their
