treated as having become entitled to at a time on or after 6 April 2015 when fewer than 11 other individuals were entitled to present payment of a scheme pension under the scheme. 4A For the purpose of determining whether the figure specified in subsection (2) is exceeded, any relevant withdrawal paid in a currency other than sterling is to be translated into sterling using the average exchange rate for the year ending with 31 March in the tax year in which the relevant withdrawal is paid. 5 If section 809B, 809D or 809E of ITA 2007 (remittance basis) applies to the person for the year of return, any relevant withdrawal within subsection (3) that was remitted to the United Kingdom in the temporary period of non-residence is to be treated as remitted to the United Kingdom in the period of return. 6 This section does not apply to a relevant withdrawal if\u2014 a it is paid to or in respect of a relieved member of the scheme and is not referable to the member's  UK  tax-relieved fund under the scheme, or b it is paid to or in respect of a transfer member of the scheme and is not referable to the member's relevant transfer fund under the scheme. 7 Nothing in any double taxation relief arrangements is to be read as preventing the person from being chargeable to income tax in respect of any relevant withdrawal treated by virtue of this section as arising in the period of return (or as preventing a charge to that tax from arising as a result). 8 Part 4 of Schedule 45 to FA 2013 (statutory residence test: anti-avoidance) explains\u2014 a when a person is to be regarded as  \u201ctemporarily non-resident\u201d, and b what  \u201cthe temporary period of non-residence\u201d and  \u201cthe period of return\u201d mean. 9 In this section\u2014 \u201c double taxation relief arrangements \u201d means arrangements that have effect under section 2(1) of TIOPA 2010; \u201c DTR claim \u201d means a claim for relief under section 6 of that Act; \u201c member's flexi-access drawdown fund \u201d and  \u201c dependant's flexi-access drawdown fund \u201d have the same meaning as in Part 4 of FA 2004 (see paragraphs 8A and 22A of Schedule 28 to FA 2004); \u201c remitted to the United Kingdom \u201d has the same meaning as in Chapter A1 of Part 14 of ITA 2007; \u201c scheme pension \u201d means a scheme pension within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Schedule 28 to FA 2004 or a dependants' scheme pension within the meaning of paragraphs 16 to 16C of that Schedule; \u201c the year of return \u201d means the tax year that consists of or includes the period of
