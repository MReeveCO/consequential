apply to an authority responsible for enforcing any . . .   planning control for a determination under this section with respect to works on the land carried out, or a use of the land begun, during the war period. 2 Upon an application being made to them under the last foregoing subsection, the authority shall determine whether the works or use fail to comply with any . . .   planning control which they are responsible for enforcing, and if so shall specify the . . .   control in question. 3 Where the authority determine that works or a use fail to comply as aforesaid they shall further determine whether having regard to all relevant circumstances the works or use shall, notwithstanding the failure, be deemed so to comply, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as to the time for which the works or use may be continued, the carrying out of alterations, or other matters, as the authority think expedient. 4 An application under subsection (1) of this section may be made with respect to any land by the owner or occupier thereof, or by any person who proves that he has or intends to acquire an interest in the land which will be affected by a determination given on such an application or that he has borne any of the cost of carrying out works on the land during the war period. 5 In the case of land owned or occupied by or on behalf of the Crown, or leased to, or to a person acting on behalf of, the Crown, or land with respect to which it is proved that there is held, or intended to be acquired, by or on behalf of the Crown an interest in the land which will be affected as aforesaid or that any of such cost as aforesaid has been borne by the Crown, an application under subsection (1) of this section may be made by any person acting on behalf of the Crown. 6 An application under subsection (1) of this section shall be accompanied by such plans and other information as are necessary to enable the application to be determined. 7 The authority to whom an application under subsection (1) of this section is made shall within fourteen days from the receipt of the application publish notice thereof in one or more local newspapers circulating in the area in which the land is situated and serve notice thereof on any person appearing to the authority to be specially affected by the application, and shall take into consideration any representations made to them in connection with the application within fourteen days from the publication of the notice; and if within two months from the last day on which such representations may be made the authority have failed to determine the application, the applicant may serve notice on the authority that he appeals to  the Secretary of State , and thereupon the authority shall be deemed to have refused to entertain the application. 8 Where the applicant is aggrieved by a determination given by an authority under this section or by the refusal of an authority to entertain an application made thereunder, or where a person by whom representations have been made as mentioned in the last foregoing subsection is aggrieved by such a determination, he may within the period of twenty-eight days after he has notice of the determination or refusal, or such extended period as  the Secretary of State  may allow, appeal to  the Secretary of State , and  the Secretary of State  may give, in substitution for the determination, if any, given by the authority, such determination as appears to him to be proper having regard to all relevant circumstances, or, if he is satisfied that the applicant was not a person entitled to make the application, may decide that the application is not to be entertained: Provided that at any stage of the proceedings on such an appeal to him  the Secretary of State  may, and shall if so directed by the High Court, state in the form of a special case for the opinion of the High Court any question of law arising in connection with the appeal. 9 Subject as hereinafter provided and to any determination or decision of  the Secretary of State  on an appeal under the last foregoing subsection, any determination given by an authority under this section and any refusal of an authority to entertain an application for such a determination shall be final, and any such determination or decision of  the Secretary of State  shall be final: Provided that where a determination has been given under subsection (3) of this section that works on land or a use of land shall not be deemed to comply with a . . .   planning control or shall be deemed to comply therewith subject to conditions, then if a person entitled to make an application under subsection (1) of this section with respect to the land satisfies the authority or on appeal  the Secretary of State  that there has been a material change of circumstances since the previous application was determined, he may make a subsequent application under the said subsection (1) and on such an application the authority or on appeal  the Secretary of State  may substitute for the determination such determination under subsection (3) of this section as appears proper having regard to all relevant circumstances. 10 If it appears to  the Secretary of State  that it is expedient, having regard to considerations affecting the public interest, whether generally or in the locality concerned, that any application under subsection (1) of this section to an authority responsible for enforcing planning control, or any class or description of such applications, should instead of being determined by the authority be referred to  the Secretary of State  for decision,  the Secretary of State  may give directions to the authority requiring that application, or applications of that class or description, to be so referred, and this section shall apply to any such reference as if it were an appeal under subsection (8) of this section from a refusal of the authority to entertain the application. 11 The Secretary of State  may give directions to any authority responsible for enforcing planning control requiring them to furnish him with such information with respect to applications under subsection (1) of this section received by them as he considers necessary or expedient in connection with the exercise of his functions under this section. 12 On any application or appeal under this section the applicant, or in the case of an application referred to  the Secretary of State  for decision or in the case of an appeal to  the Secretary of State  the applicant or the authority responsible for enforcing the . . .   planning control in question, may require the authority or  the Secretary of State  by whom the application or appeal is to be determined to afford him or them an opportunity before the application or appeal is determined of appearing before and being heard by a person appointed by the authority or  the Secretary of State  for the purpose."},
