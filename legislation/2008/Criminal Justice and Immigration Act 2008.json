imprisonment and detention 240A 1 This section applies where\u2014 a a court sentences an offender to imprisonment for a term in respect of an offence committed on or after 4th April 2005, b the offender was remanded on bail by a court in course of or in connection with proceedings for the offence, or any related offence, after the coming into force of section 21 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, and c the offender's bail was subject to a qualifying curfew condition and an electronic monitoring condition (\u201cthe relevant conditions\u201d). 2 Subject to subsection (4), the court must direct that the credit period is to count as time served by the offender as part of the sentence. 3 The  \u201c credit period \u201d is the number of days represented by half of the sum of\u2014 a the day on which the offender's bail was first subject to conditions that, had they applied throughout the day in question, would have been relevant conditions, and b the number of other days on which the offender's bail was subject to those conditions (excluding the last day on which it was so subject), rounded up to the nearest whole number. 4 Subsection (2) does not apply if and to the extent that\u2014 a rules made by the Secretary of State so provide, or b it is in the opinion of the court just in all the circumstances not to give a direction under that subsection. 5 Where as a result of paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (4) the court does not give a direction under subsection (2), it may give a direction in accordance with either of those paragraphs to the effect that a period of days which is less than the credit period is to count as time served by the offender as part of the sentence. 6 Rules made under subsection (4)(a) may, in particular, make provision in relation to\u2014 a sentences of imprisonment for consecutive terms; b sentences of imprisonment for terms which are wholly or partly concurrent; c periods during which a person granted bail subject to the relevant conditions is also subject to electronic monitoring required by an order made by a court or the Secretary of State. 7 In considering whether it is of the opinion mentioned in subsection (4)(b) the court must, in particular, take into account whether or not the offender has, at any time whilst on bail subject to the relevant conditions, broken either or both of them. 8 Where the court gives a direction under subsection (2) or (5) it shall state in open court\u2014 a the number of days on which the offender was subject to the relevant conditions, and b the number of days in relation to which the direction is given. 9 Subsection (10) applies where the court\u2014 a does not give a direction under subsection (2) but gives a direction under subsection (5), or b decides not to give a direction under this section. 10 The court shall state in open court\u2014 a that its decision is in accordance with rules made under paragraph (a) of subsection (4), or b that it is of the opinion mentioned in paragraph (b) of that subsection and what the circumstances are. 11 Subsections (7) to (10) of section 240 apply for the purposes of this section as they apply for

Act                                    \u201d ; and b in subsection (8) the reference to subsection (3) of section 240 is to be read as a reference to subsection (2) of this section and, in paragraph (b), after  \u201cChapter\u201d there were inserted  \u201c                                  or Part 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991                                \u201d . 12 In this section\u2014 \u201c electronic monitoring condition \u201d means any electronic monitoring requirements imposed under section 3(6ZAA) of the Bail Act 1976 for the purpose of securing the electronic monitoring of a person's compliance with a qualifying curfew condition; \u201c qualifying curfew condition \u201d means a condition of bail which requires the person granted bail to remain at one or more specified

the person in default to comply with\u2014 a in the case of a person aged 16 or 17, an unpaid work requirement (see   Part 3 of Schedule 6 to the Sentencing Code ), b an attendance centre requirement

Sentencing Code), and b must do so where, in the case of a youth rehabilitation order, such a requirement would be required by paragraph 19(3) of Schedule 6 to the Sentencing Code. 5 Where a magistrates' court has power to make a youth default order, it may, if it thinks it expedient to do so, postpone the making of the order until such time and on such conditions (if any) as it thinks just. 6 The following provisions of the Sentencing Code have effect in relation to youth default orders as they have effect in relation to youth rehabilitation orders, but subject to the modifications contained in Schedule 7 to this Act\u2014 a sections 186(2), (10) and (11), 188, 190 to 192, 197, 198(3) to (5),   198A,  397(1), 400 and 403 to 405 (youth rehabilitation orders: responsible officer, interpretation and further provisions), b Parts 3, 5  and 7  of Schedule 6 (youth rehabilitation orders: requirements), ba Part 17 of that Schedule (electronic monitoring requirements), so far as it applies to electronic compliance monitoring requirements, c Schedule 7 (breach, revocation or amendment of youth rehabilitation order), d Schedule 8 (transfer of youth rehabilitation orders to Northern Ireland), and e paragraph 9 of Schedule 23 (power to amend limits). 7 Where a youth default order has been made for default in paying any sum\u2014 a on payment of the whole sum to any person authorised to receive it, the order ceases to have effect, and b on payment of a part of the sum to any such person, the total number of hours or days to which the order relates is to be taken to be

assess the amount of compensation payable to or in respect of a person under section 133 for a miscarriage of justice. 2 In assessing so much of any compensation payable under section 133 as is attributable to suffering, harm to reputation or similar damage, the assessor must have regard in particular to\u2014 a the seriousness of the offence of which the person was convicted and the severity of the punishment suffered as a result of the conviction, and b the conduct of the investigation and prosecution of the offence. 3 The assessor may make from the total amount of compensation that the assessor would otherwise have assessed as payable under section 133 any deduction or deductions that the assessor considers appropriate by reason of either or both of the following\u2014 a any conduct of the person appearing to the assessor to have directly or indirectly caused, or contributed to, the conviction concerned; and b any other convictions of the person and any punishment suffered as a result of them. 4 If, having had regard to any matters falling within subsection (3)(a) or (b), the assessor considers that there are exceptional circumstances which justify doing so, the assessor may determine that the amount of compensation payable under section 133 is to be a nominal amount only. 5 The total amount of compensation payable to or in respect of a person under section 133 for a particular miscarriage of justice must not exceed the overall compensation limit. That limit is\u2014 a \u00a31 million in a case to which section 133B applies, and b \u00a3500,000 in any other case. 6 The total amount of compensation payable under section 133 for a person's loss of earnings or earnings capacity in respect of any one year must not exceed the earnings compensation limit. That limit is an amount equal to 1.5 times the median annual gross earnings according to the latest figures published by the Office of National Statistics at the time of the assessment. 7 The Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument amend subsection (5) or (6) so as to alter any amount for the time being specified as the overall compensation limit or the earnings compensation limit. 8 No order may be made under subsection (7) unless a draft of the order has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament. Cases where person has been detained for at least 10 years 133B 1 For the purposes of section 133A(5) this section applies to any case where the person concerned (\u201cP\u201d) has been in qualifying detention for a period (or total period) of at least 10 years by the time when\u2014 a the conviction is reversed, or b the pardon is given, as mentioned in section 133(1). 2 P was  \u201cin qualifying detention\u201d at any time when P was detained in a prison, a hospital or at any other place, if P was so detained\u2014 a by virtue of a sentence passed in respect of the relevant offence, b under mental health legislation by reason of P's conviction of that offence (disregarding any conditions other than the fact of the conviction that had to be fulfilled in order for P to be so detained), or c as a result of P's having been remanded in custody in connection with the relevant offence or with any other offence the charge for which was founded on the same facts or evidence as that for the relevant offence. 3 In calculating the period (or total period) during which P has been in qualifying detention as mentioned in subsection (1), no account is to be taken of any period of time during which P was both\u2014 a in qualifying detention, and b in excluded concurrent detention. 4 P was  \u201cin excluded concurrent detention\u201d at any time when P was detained in a prison, a hospital or at any other place, if P was so detained\u2014 a during the term of a sentence passed in respect of an offence other than the relevant offence, b under mental health legislation by reason of P's conviction of any such other offence (disregarding any conditions other than the fact of the conviction that had to be fulfilled in order for P to be so detained), or c as a result of P's having been remanded in custody in connection with an offence for which P was subsequently convicted other than\u2014 i the relevant offence, or ii any other offence the charge for which was founded on the same facts or evidence as that for the relevant offence. 5 But P was not  \u201cin excluded concurrent detention\u201d at any time by virtue of subsection (4)(a), (b) or (c) if P's conviction of the other offence mentioned in that provision was quashed on appeal, or a pardon was given in respect of it. 6 In this section\u2014 \u201c mental health legislation \u201d means\u2014 Part 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983, Part 3 of the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986, or the provisions of any earlier enactment corresponding to Part 3 of that Act or Part 3 of that Order; \u201c the relevant offence \u201d means the offence in respect of which the conviction is quashed or the pardon is given (but see subsection (7)); \u201c remanded in custody \u201d is to be read in accordance with subsections (8) and (9); \u201c reversed \u201d has the same meaning as in section 133 of this Act. 7 If, as a result of the miscarriage of justice\u2014 a two or more convictions are reversed, or b a pardon is given in respect of two or more offences, \u201c the relevant offence \u201d means any of the offences concerned. 8 In relation to England and Wales,  \u201c remanded in custody \u201d has the meaning given by section 242(2)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Criminal Justice Act 2003, but that subsection applies for the purposes of this section as if any reference there to a provision of the Mental Health Act 1983 included a reference to any corresponding provision of any earlier enactment. 9 In relation to Northern Ireland,  \u201c remanded in custody \u201d means\u2014 a remanded in or committed to custody by an order of a court, or b remanded, admitted or removed to hospital under Article 42, 43, 45 or 54 of the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 or under any corresponding provision of any earlier enactment. 8 In section 172 (extent) in subsection (3)\t\t\t\t\t(provisions extending to Northern Ireland as well as England and Wales) for  \u201csection 133\u201d substitute  \u201c                    sections 133 to 133B                  \u201d . 9 This section extends to England and Wales and Northern Ireland."}, {"act": "Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008", "year": 2008, "section": "62", "section_title": "Annual report on Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998", "section_text": "62 1 Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 (c. 40)\t\t\t\t\t(requirement for annual report on working of the Act) ceases to have effect. 2 The following provisions, namely\u2014 a subsection (1), and b the repeal of section 8 of that Act in Part 4 of Schedule 28, extend to England and Wales and Northern Ireland."}, {"act": "Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008", "year": 2008, "section": "63", "section_title": "Possession of extreme pornographic images", "section_text": "63 1 It is an offence for a person to be in possession of an extreme pornographic image. 2 An  \u201c extreme pornographic image \u201d is an image which is both\u2014 a pornographic, and b an extreme image. 3 An image is  \u201c pornographic \u201d if it is of such a nature that it must reasonably be assumed to have been produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal. 4 Where (as found in the person's possession) an image forms part of a series of images, the question whether the image is of such a nature as is mentioned in subsection (3) is to be determined by reference to\u2014 a the image itself, and b (if the series of images is such as to be capable of providing a context for the image) the context in which it occurs in the series of images. 5 So, for example, where\u2014 a an image forms an integral part of a narrative constituted by a series of images, and b having regard to those images as a whole, they are not of such a nature that they must reasonably be assumed to have been produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal, the image may, by virtue of being part of that narrative, be found not to be pornographic, even though it might have been found to be pornographic if taken by itself. 5A In relation to possession of an image in England and Wales, an  \u201cextreme image\u201d is an image which\u2014 a falls within subsection (7) or (7A), and b is grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character. 6   In relation to possession of an image in Northern Ireland, an    \u201c extreme image \u201d is an image which\u2014 a falls within subsection (7)  or (7A)  , and b is grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character. 7 An image falls within this subsection if it portrays, in an explicit and realistic way, any of the following\u2014 a an act which threatens a person's life, b an act which results, or is likely to result, in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals, c an act which involves sexual interference with a human corpse, or d a person performing an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive), and a reasonable person looking at the image would think that any such person or animal was real. 7A An image falls within this subsection if it portrays, in an explicit and realistic way, either of the following\u2014 a an act which involves the non-consensual penetration of a person's vagina, anus or mouth by another with the other person's penis, or b an act which involves the non-consensual sexual penetration of a person's vagina or anus by another with a part of the other person's body or anything else, and a reasonable person looking at the image would think that the persons were real. 7B For the purposes of subsection (7A)\u2014 a penetration is a continuing act from entry to withdrawal;

 and aa the common law defence of defence of property; and b the defences provided by section 3(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 (c. 58) or section 3(1) of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 (c. 18 (N.I.)) (use of force in prevention of crime or making arrest). 3 The question whether the degree of force used by D was reasonable in the circumstances is to be decided by reference to the circumstances as D believed them to be, and subsections (4) to (8) also apply in connection with deciding that question. 4 If D claims to have held a particular belief as regards the existence of any circumstances\u2014 a the reasonableness or otherwise of that belief is relevant to the question whether D genuinely held it; but b if it is determined that D did genuinely hold it, D is entitled to rely on it for the purposes of subsection (3), whether or not\u2014 i it was mistaken, or ii (if it was mistaken) the mistake was a reasonable one to have made. 5 But subsection (4)(b) does not enable D to rely on any mistaken belief attributable to intoxication that was voluntarily induced. 5A In a householder case, the degree of force used by D is not to be regarded as having been reasonable in the circumstances as D believed them to be if it was grossly disproportionate in those circumstances. 6   In a case other than a householder case,  the degree of force used by D is not to be regarded as having been reasonable in the circumstances as D believed them to be if it was disproportionate in those circumstances. 6A In deciding the question mentioned in subsection (3), a possibility that D could have retreated is to be considered (so far as relevant) as a factor to be taken into account, rather than as giving rise to a duty to retreat. 7 In deciding the question mentioned in subsection (3) the following considerations are to be taken into account (so far as relevant in the circumstances of the case)\u2014 a that a person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh to a nicety the exact measure of any necessary action; and b that evidence of a person's having only done what the person honestly and instinctively thought was necessary for a legitimate purpose constitutes strong evidence that only reasonable action was taken by that person for that purpose. 8 Subsection (7) is   Subsections (6A) and (7) are   not to be read as preventing other matters from being taken into account where they are relevant to deciding the question mentioned in subsection (3). 8A For the purposes of this section  \u201ca householder case\u201d is a case where\u2014 a the defence concerned is the common law defence of self-defence, b the force concerned is force used by D while in or partly in a building, or part of a building, that is a dwelling or is forces accommodation (or is both), c D is not a trespasser at the time the force is used, and d at that time D believed V to be in, or entering, the building or part as a trespasser. 8B Where\u2014 a a part of a building is a dwelling where D dwells, b another part of the building is a place of work for D or another person who dwells in the first part, and c that other part is internally accessible from the first part, that other part, and any internal means of access between the two parts, are each treated for the purposes of subsection (8A) as a part of a building that is a dwelling. 8C Where\u2014 a a part of a building is forces accommodation that is living or sleeping accommodation for D, b another part of the building is a place of work for D or another person for whom the first part is living or sleeping accommodation, and c that other part is internally accessible from the first part, that other part, and any internal means of access between the two parts, are each treated for the purposes of subsection (8A) as a part of a building that is forces accommodation. 8D Subsections (4) and (5) apply for the purposes of subsection (8A)(d) as they apply for the purposes of subsection (3). 8E The fact that a person derives title from a trespasser, or has the permission of a trespasser, does not prevent the person from being a trespasser for the purposes of subsection (8A). 8F In subsections (8A) to (8C)\u2014 \u201c building \u201d includes a vehicle or vessel, and \u201c forces accommodation \u201d means service living accommodation for the purposes of Part 3 of the Armed Forces Act

the relevant Minister in the United Kingdom and the appropriate authority in a country or territory outside the British Islands. 2 A person falls within this subsection if that person\u2014 a is a

the provisions of this Act or any similar provisions of the law of any part of the United Kingdom; and b is present in a country or territory outside the British Islands. 3 A person falls within this subsection if that person\u2014 a is a person to whom section 1(7) applies by virtue of \u2014 i an order made in the course of the exercise by a court or tribunal in a country or territory outside

international arrangements providing for the transfer between the United Kingdom and a country or territory outside the British Islands of responsibility for the detention and release of persons to whom subsection (2) or (3) applies, b the relevant Minister and the appropriate authority of that country or territory have each agreed to the transfer under those arrangements of responsibility for the detention and release of a particular person to whom subsection (2) or (3) applies (in this Act referred to as  \u201c the relevant person \u201d), and c in a case in which the terms of those arrangements provide for the transfer of responsibility to take place only with the relevant person's consent, that consent has been given, the relevant Minister shall issue a warrant providing for the transfer of responsibility for the detention and release of the relevant person from that Minister (where subsection (2) applies) or to that Minister (where subsection (3) applies). 6 The relevant Minister shall not issue a warrant under this section providing for the transfer of responsibility for the detention and release of a person to the relevant Minister unless\u2014 a that person is a British citizen; b the transfer appears to the relevant Minister to be appropriate having regard to any close ties which that person has with the United Kingdom. 7 The relevant Minister shall not issue a warrant under this section where, after the duty in subsection (5) has arisen, circumstances arise or are brought to his attention which in his opinion make it inappropriate that the transfer of responsibility should take place. 8 The relevant Minister shall not issue a warrant under this section (other than one superseding an earlier warrant) unless he is satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to inform the relevant person in writing in his own language\u2014 a of the substance, so far as relevant to the case, of the international arrangements in accordance with which it is proposed to transfer responsibility for his detention and release; b of the effect in relation to the relevant person of the warrant which it is proposed to issue under this section; c in the

that warrant and subsequent release (including the effect of any enactment or instrument under which he may be released earlier than provided for by the terms of the warrant); and e of the powers of the relevant Minister under section 6; and the relevant Minister shall not issue a warrant superseding an earlier warrant under this section unless the requirements of this subsection were fulfilled in relation to the earlier warrant. 9 A consent given for the purposes of subsection (5)(c) shall not be capable of being withdrawn after a warrant under this section has been issued in respect of the relevant person; and, accordingly, a purported withdrawal of that consent after that time shall not affect the validity of the warrant, or of any provision which by virtue of section 6 subsequently supersedes provisions of that warrant, or of any direction given in relation to the prisoner under section 4B(3). 10 In this section  \u201c relevant Minister \u201d means\u2014 a the Scottish Ministers in a case where the person who is the subject of the proposed transfer of responsibility is\u2014 i a person to whom subsection (2) applies who is for the time being required to be detained at a place in Scotland; or ii a person to whom subsection (3) applies, if it is proposed that he will be detained at a place in Scotland; b the Secretary of State, in any other case. Transfer of responsibility from the United Kingdom 4B 1 The effect of a warrant under section 4A relating to a person to whom subsection (2) of that section applies shall be to transfer responsibility for the detention and release of that person from the relevant Minister (as defined in section 4A(10)) to the appropriate authority of the country or territory in which he is present. 2 Subject to subsections (3) to (6), the order by virtue of which the relevant person is required to be detained at the time such a warrant is issued in respect of him shall continue to have effect after the transfer of responsibility so as to apply to him if he comes to be in the United Kingdom at any time when under that order he is to be, or may be, detained. 3 If, at any time after the transfer of responsibility, it appears to the relevant Minister appropriate to do so in order that effect may be given to the international arrangements in accordance with which the transfer took place, the relevant Minister may give a direction\u2014 a varying the order referred to in subsection (2); or b providing for the order to cease to have effect. 4 In subsection (3)  \u201c relevant Minister \u201d means\u2014 a the Scottish Ministers, where Scotland is the part of the United Kingdom in which the order referred to in subsection (2) has effect; and b the Secretary of State in any other case. 5 The power by direction under subsection (3) to vary the order referred to in subsection (2) includes power by direction\u2014 a to provide for how any period during which the detention and release of the relevant person is, by virtue of a warrant under section 4A, the responsibility of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom is to be treated for the purposes of the order; and b to provide for the relevant person to be treated as having been released or discharged as mentioned in any paragraph of section 2(4)(b). 6 Except in relation to any period during which a restriction order is in force in respect of the relevant person, subsection (2) shall not apply in relation to a hospital order; and, accordingly, a hospital order shall cease to have effect in relation to that person\u2014 a at the time of the transfer of responsibility, if no restriction order is in force in respect of him at that time; and b if at that time a restriction order is in force in respect of him, as soon after the transfer of responsibility as the restriction order ceases to have effect. 7 In subsection (6)  \u201c hospital order \u201d and  \u201c restriction order \u201d have the same meaning as in section 2(6). 8 References in this section to the order by virtue of which a person is required to be detained at the time a warrant under section 4A is issued in respect of him include references to any order by virtue of which he is required to be detained after the order by virtue of which he is required to be detained at that time ceases to have effect.

and b the detention of that person in any part of the United Kingdom in accordance with such provisions as may be contained in the warrant, being provisions appearing to the relevant Minister to be appropriate for giving effect to the international arrangements in accordance with which responsibility for that person is transferred. 2 A provision shall not be contained by virtue of subsection (1)(b) in a warrant under section 4A unless it satisfies the following two conditions, that is to say\u2014 a it is a provision with respect to the detention of a person in a prison, a hospital or any other institution; and b it is a provision which at the time the warrant is issued may be contained in an order made either\u2014 i in the course of the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction by a court in the part of the United Kingdom in which the person is to be detained; or ii otherwise than by a court but for the purpose of giving effect to an order made as mentioned in sub-paragraph (i). 3 Section 3(3) applies for determining for the purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) above what provisions are appropriate for giving effect to the international arrangements mentioned in that paragraph in a relevant person's case as it applies for the purposes of section 3(1)(c) in the case of a prisoner who is to be transferred into the United Kingdom. 4 Subject to subsection (6) and Part 2 of the Schedule to this Act, a provision contained by virtue of subsection (1)(b) in a warrant under section 4A shall for all purposes have the same effect as the same provision contained in an order made as mentioned in sub-paragraph (i) or, as the case may be, sub-paragraph (ii) of subsection (2)(b). 5 A provision contained by virtue of subsection (1)(b) in a warrant under section 4A shall take effect with the delivery of the relevant person to the place specified in the warrant for the purposes of subsection (1)(a). 6 Subsection (4) shall not confer any right of appeal on the relevant person against provisions contained by virtue of subsection (1)(b) in a warrant under this section. 7 Part 2 of the Schedule to this Act shall have effect with respect to the operation of certain enactments in relation to provisions contained by virtue of subsection (1)(b) in a warrant under section 4A. 8 For the purposes of determining whether at any particular time any such order as is mentioned in subsection (2)(b) could have been made as so mentioned, there shall be disregarded both\u2014 a any requirement that certain conditions must be satisfied before the order is made;
