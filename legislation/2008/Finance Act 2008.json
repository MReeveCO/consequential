33A 1 This section applies where a person carrying on a qualifying activity incurs expenditure on the provision or replacement of an integral feature of a building or structure used by the person for the purposes of the qualifying activity. 2 This Part (including in particular section 11(4)) applies as if\u2014 a the expenditure were capital expenditure on the provision of plant or machinery for the purposes of the qualifying activity, and b the person who incurred the expenditure owned plant or machinery as a result of incurring it. 3 If the expenditure is qualifying expenditure, it may not be deducted in calculating the income from the qualifying activity. 4 If the expenditure is not qualifying expenditure, whether it may be so deducted is to be determined without regard to this section. 5 For the purposes of this section each of the following is an integral feature\u2014 a an electrical system (including a lighting system), b a cold water system, c a space or water heating system, a powered system of ventilation, air cooling or air purification, and any floor or ceiling comprised in such a system, d a lift, an escalator or a moving walkway, e external solar shading. 6 The items listed in subsection (5) do not include any asset whose principal purpose is to insulate or enclose the interior of a building or to provide an interior wall, floor or ceiling which (in each case) is intended to remain permanently in place. 7 The Treasury may by order\u2014 a provide that subsection (5) does not include a feature of a building or structure specified in the order, expenditure on which would (if not within subsection (5)) be qualifying expenditure other than special rate expenditure, and b add to the list in subsection (5) a feature of a building or structure expenditure on the provision of which would not (apart from the order) be expenditure on the provision of plant or machinery. 8 An order under subsection (7) may make such incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision as the Treasury thinks fit. Meaning of  \u201creplacement\u201d in section 33A 33B 1 Expenditure to which this section applies is to be treated for the purposes of section 33A as expenditure on the replacement of an integral feature. 2 This section applies to expenditure incurred by a person on an integral feature if the amount of the expenditure is more than 50% of the cost of replacing the integral feature at the time the expenditure is incurred. 3 Subsection (4) applies where\u2014 a a person incurs expenditure (\u201cinitial expenditure\u201d) on an integral feature which is not more than 50% of the cost of replacing the integral feature at the time it is incurred, but b in the period of 12 months beginning with the initial expenditure being incurred the person incurs further expenditure on the integral feature. 4 If the aggregate of\u2014 a the amount of the initial expenditure, and b the amount (or the aggregate of the amounts) of the further expenditure, is more than 50% of the cost of replacing the integral feature at the time the initial expenditure was incurred, this section applies to the initial expenditure and the further expenditure. 5 Where section 33A applies because of subsection (4), all such assessments and adjustments of assessments are to be made as are necessary to give effect to that section. 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 In Chapter

period mentioned in subsection (1)(b), E paid pension contributions under the original scheme of the amount of the relevant relief, and b the purpose, or one of the purposes, of facilitating the

residential property, and b one whose subject-matter consists of all of the interests in land that is non-residential property. 5 For that purpose, the chargeable consideration attributable to each of those separate transactions (or sets of linked transactions) is the chargeable consideration so attributable on a just and reasonable apportionment. 6 In this paragraph  \u201c the relevant rent \u201d means\u2014 a the annual rent in relation to the transaction in question, or b if that transaction is one of a number of linked transactions for which the chargeable consideration consists of
