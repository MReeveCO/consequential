b in the case of an order made by the Secretary of State, means a generating station which is not situated in Scotland. 13 For this purpose  \u201c Scotland \u201d is to be construed in accordance with section 32(3). Section 32B: supplemental provision 32C 1 A renewables obligation order may provide\u2014 a that no renewables obligation certificates are to be issued in respect of electricity generated in specified cases or circumstances, or b that renewables obligation certificates are to be issued in respect of a proportion only of the electricity generated in specified cases or circumstances. 2 In particular, provision made by virtue of subsection (1) may specify\u2014 a electricity generated using specified descriptions of renewable sources, b electricity generated by specified descriptions of generating station, or c electricity generated in specified ways. 3 Provision made by virtue of subsection (1)(b) may include\u2014 a provision about how the proportion is to be determined; b provision about what, subject to such exceptions as may be specified, constitutes sufficient evidence of any matter required to be established for the purpose of determining that proportion; c provision authorising the Authority, in specified circumstances, to require an operator of a generating station to arrange\u2014 i for samples of any fuel used (or to be used) in the generating station, or of any gas or other substance produced as a result of the use of such fuel, to be taken by a person, and analysed in a manner, approved by the Authority, and ii for the results of that analysis to be made available to the Authority. 4 In the case of electricity generated by a generating station fuelled or driven\u2014 a partly by renewable sources, and b partly by fossil fuel (other than waste which constitutes a renewable source), only the proportion attributable to the renewable sources is to be regarded as generated from such sources. 5 A renewables obligation order may specify\u2014 a how the proportion referred to in subsection (4) is to be determined, and b the consequences for the issuing of renewables obligation certificates if a generating station of the type mentioned in that subsection uses more than a specified proportion of fossil fuel during a specified period. 6 Those consequences may include the consequence that no certificates are to be issued in respect of any of the electricity generated by that generating station during that period. 7 A renewables obligation order may specify circumstances in which the Authority may revoke a renewables obligation certificate before its production for the purposes of the renewables obligation. 8 A renewables obligation order must\u2014 a prohibit the issue of a renewables obligation certificate certifying matters within section 32B(4) or (6) where the Northern Ireland authority has notified the Authority that it is not satisfied that the electricity in question has been supplied to customers in Northern Ireland, and b require the revocation of such a certificate if the Northern Ireland authority so notifies the Authority at a time between the issue of the certificate and its production for the purposes of the renewables obligation. 9 References in section 32B and this section to the supply of electricity to customers in Northern Ireland are to be construed in accordance with the definition of  \u201csupply\u201d in Article 3 of the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992. Amounts of electricity specified in certificates 32D 1 A renewables obligation order may specify the amount of electricity to be stated in each renewables obligation certificate, and different amounts may be specified in relation to different cases or circumstances. 2 In particular, different amounts may be specified in relation to\u2014 a electricity generated from different renewable sources; b electricity generated by different descriptions of generating station; c electricity generated in different ways. 3 In this section  \u201c banding provision \u201d means provision made in a renewables obligation order by virtue of subsection (1). 4 Before making any banding provision, the relevant minister must have regard to the following matters\u2014 a the costs (including capital costs) associated with generating electricity from each of the renewable sources or with transmitting or distributing electricity so generated; b the income of operators of generating stations in respect of electricity generated from each of those sources or associated with the generation of such electricity; c the effect of paragraph 19 of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 2000 (c. 17)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(supplies of electricity from renewable sources exempted from climate change levy) in relation to electricity generated from each of those sources; d the desirability of securing the long term growth, and economic viability, of the industries associated with the generation of electricity from renewable sources; e the likely effect of the proposed banding provision on the number of renewables obligation certificates issued by the Authority, and the impact this will have on the market for such certificates and on consumers; f the potential contribution of electricity generated from each renewable source to the attainment of any target which relates to the generation of electricity or the production of energy and is imposed by, or results from or arises out of,   an EU  obligation. 5 For the purposes of subsection (4)(a), the costs associated with generating electricity from a renewable source include any costs associated with the production or supply of heat produced in connection with that generation. 6 For the purposes of subsection (4)(b), an operator's income associated with the generation of electricity from a renewable source includes any income connected with\u2014 a the acquisition of the renewable source; b the supply of heat produced in connection with the generation; c the disposal of any by-product of the generation process. 7 After the first order containing banding provision is made by the relevant minister, no subsequent order containing such provision may be made by that minister except following a review held by virtue of subsection (8). 8 A renewables obligation order\u2014 a may authorise the relevant minister to review the banding provision at such intervals as are specified in or determined in accordance with the order, and b may authorise the relevant minister to review the whole or any part of the banding provision at any time when that minister is satisfied that one or more of the specified conditions is satisfied. Section 32D: transitional provision and savings 32E 1 This section applies where a renewables obligation order contains banding provision. 2 The order may provide for the effect of any banding provision made in an earlier order, or of any provision of a pre-commencement order, to continue, in such circumstances as may be specified, in relation to\u2014 a the electricity generated by generating stations of such a description as may be specified, or b so much of that electricity as may be determined in accordance with the order. 3 For the purposes of subsection (2)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201c pre-commencement order \u201d means an order made under section 32 before the coming into force of this section. 4 Subsection (6) applies to a generating station in respect of which a statutory grant has been awarded if\u2014 a the generating station is of a specified description, or b the circumstances of the case meet specified requirements. 5 The requirements specified under subsection (4)(b) may relate to the time when the grant was awarded (whether a time before or after the coming into force of this section). 6 A renewables obligation order which contains banding provision may provide for the operation of that provision in relation to electricity generated by a generating station to which this subsection applies to be conditional upon the operator of the station agreeing\u2014 a if the grant or any part of it has been paid, to repay to the Secretary of State the whole or a specified part of the grant or part before the repayment date, b to pay to the Secretary of State interest on an amount repayable under paragraph (a) for such period, and at such rate, as may be determined by the Secretary of State, and c if the grant or any part of it has not yet been paid, to consent to the cancellation of the award of the grant or part. 7 If the grant in respect of which an amount falls to be paid under paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (6) was paid by the Scottish Ministers, the references in those paragraphs to the Secretary of State are to be read as references to those Ministers. 8 For the purposes of subsection (6)\u2014 a \u201c the repayment date \u201d means the date specified in or determined in accordance with the order, and b the period for which interest is payable must not begin before the grant was paid or, if the repayment relates to an instalment of the grant, before the instalment was paid; and, for the purposes of provision made under that subsection, a renewables obligation order may make provision about the cancellation of an award of a statutory grant or an instalment of such a grant. 9 In this section  \u201c statutory grant \u201d means\u2014 a a grant awarded under section 5(1) of the Science and Technology Act 1965 (grants to carry on or support scientific research), or b any other grant which is payable out of public funds and awarded under or by virtue of an Act. 10 This section is without prejudice to section 32K(1)(b)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(power for renewables obligation order to include transitional provision and savings). Use of renewables obligation certificates issued in Northern Ireland 32F 1 A renewables obligation order may provide that\u2014 a in such cases as may be specified in the order, and b subject to such conditions as may be so specified, an electricity supplier may (to the extent provided for in accordance with the order) discharge its renewables obligation (or its obligation in relation to a particular period) by the production to the Authority of a Northern Ireland certificate. 2 In this section  \u201c Northern Ireland certificate \u201d means a certificate issued by the Northern Ireland authority in accordance with provision included, by virtue of Article 54 of the Energy (Northern Ireland) Order 2003, in an order under Article 52 of that Order (renewables obligations for Northern Ireland suppliers). Payment as alternative to complying with renewables obligation order 32G 1 A renewables obligation order may provide\u2014 a that an electricity supplier may (in whole or in part) discharge its renewables obligation by making a payment to the Authority before the last discharge day, and b that an electricity supplier's renewables obligation that was not discharged in whole or in part before the last discharge day is to be treated as having been discharged to the extent specified in the order where the payment for which the order provides is made to the Authority before the end of the late payment period. 2 The order may make provision\u2014 a as to the sum which for the purposes of subsection (1) is to correspond to a renewables obligation certificate, b for the sums that must be paid in order for an obligation to be treated as having been discharged to increase at a rate specified in the order for each day after the last discharge day; c for different sums or rates falling within paragraph (a) or (b) in relation to different periods; d for different such sums or rates in relation to electricity generated in different cases or circumstances specified in the order (including those of a kind referred to in section 32A(2)(c)); e for any such sum or rate to be adjusted from time to time for inflation by a method specified in the order. 3 The method specified under subsection (2)(e) may, in particular, refer to a specified scale or index (as it may have effect from time to time) or to other specified data of any description. 4 A renewables obligation order may provide that, where\u2014 a a renewables obligation is one in relation to which provision made by virtue of subsection (1)(b) applies in the case of the electricity supplier who is subject to the obligation, and b the period ending with such day (after the last discharge day) as may be specified in or determined under the order has not expired, the taking of steps under section 27A in respect of a contravention by that supplier of that obligation is prohibited or otherwise restricted to the extent specified in the order. 5 A renewables obligation order may provide that, in a case in which the amount received by the Authority, or by the Northern Ireland authority, by way of discharge payments for a period falls short of the amount due in respect of that period, every person who\u2014 a was subject to a renewables obligation for the relevant period or for a subsequent period specified in or determined under the order, and b is of a description so specified or determined, must by the time and in the circumstances so specified or determined make a payment (or further payment) to the Authority of an amount calculated in the manner so specified or determined. 6 A renewables obligation order may not by virtue of subsection (5) confer an entitlement on the Authority to receive a payment in respect of the shortfall for any period\u2014 a in the case of a shortfall in the amount received by the Authority, if the receipt of the payment is to be while a prohibition or restriction by virtue of subsection (4) applies, in one or more cases, to the taking of steps in relation to contraventions of renewables obligations for that period, or b in the case of a shortfall in the amount received by the Northern Ireland authority, if the receipt of the payment is to be while a prohibition or restriction by virtue of a corresponding provision having effect in Northern Ireland applies, in one or more cases, to the taking of steps in relation to contraventions of Northern Ireland obligations for that period. 7 The provision that may be made by virtue of subsection (5) includes\u2014 a provision for the making of adjustments and repayments at times after a requirement to make payments in respect of a shortfall for a period has already arisen, and b provision that sections 25 to 28 are to apply in relation to a requirement imposed by virtue of that subsection on a person who is not a licence holder as if the person were a licence holder. 8 References in this section to an electricity supplier's renewables obligation include references to its renewables obligation in relation to a particular period. 9 For the purposes of this section, the amount received by the Authority by way of discharge payments for a period falls short of the amount due in respect of that period if, and to the extent that, the Authority would have received more by way of discharge payments if every renewables obligation for that period, so far as it was not otherwise discharged, had been discharged by payment. 10 For the purposes of this section the amount received by the Northern Ireland authority by way of discharge payments for a period falls short of the amount due in respect of that period if, and to the extent that, that authority would have received more by way of discharge payments if every Northern Ireland obligation for that period, so far as not otherwise discharged, had been discharged by payment. 11 In this section\u2014 \u201c discharge payment \u201d, in relation to a period, means\u2014 a payment by virtue of subsection (1)(a) for discharging (in whole or in part) an electricity supplier's renewables obligation for that period, so much of a payment by virtue of subsection (1)(b) for securing that such an obligation is treated as discharged to any extent as does not exceed the payment that would have discharged that obligation to the same extent if it had been made before the last discharge day, or so much of any payment to the Northern Ireland authority as corresponds in relation to a Northern Ireland obligation for that period, to anything falling within paragraph (a) or (b) above; \u201c last discharge day \u201d means the day specified as the day by which renewables obligation certificates must be produced for the purposes of section 32(6); \u201c late payment period \u201d means such period beginning with the last discharge day as may be specified; \u201c Northern Ireland obligation \u201d means a renewables obligation of a Northern Ireland supplier under Article 52 of the Energy (Northern Ireland) Order 2003; \u201c the relevant period \u201d\u2014 in relation to a shortfall in amounts received by the Authority by way of discharge payments for a period, means that period, and in relation to a shortfall in amounts received by the Northern Ireland authority by way of discharge payments for a period, means any period that includes the whole or a part of that period. Allocation of amounts to electricity suppliers 32H 1 The amounts received by the Authority by virtue of section 32G must be paid by it to electricity suppliers in accordance with a system of allocation specified in a renewables obligation order. 2 Subsection (1) does not apply to those amounts to the extent that they are used by the Authority under section 32I. 3 The system of allocation specified in the order may provide for payments to specified categories of electricity supplier only. 4 That system may also provide for the postponement of a requirement to make payments to electricity suppliers of amounts received by the Authority under section 32G(1)(b) if, at the time the payments would otherwise fall to be made, the aggregate of the amounts so received (and not used under section 32I or already paid under subsection (1)) is less than an amount specified in the order. 5 The references in this section to electricity suppliers include references to Northern Ireland suppliers. Costs of the Authority and the Northern Ireland authority 32I 1 A renewables obligation order may provide for amounts received by the Authority by virtue of section 32G to be used by the Authority\u2014 a to make payments into the Consolidated Fund in respect of costs (or a proportion of costs) which have been or are expected to be incurred by the Authority in connection with the performance of its functions conferred by or under sections 32 to 32M, or b to make payments to the Northern Ireland authority in respect of costs (or a proportion of costs) which have been or are expected to be incurred by that authority in connection with the performance of its functions conferred by or under Articles 52 to 55 of the Energy (Northern Ireland) Order 2003. 2 A renewables obligation order\u2014 a may exclude amounts of a specified description from being used as mentioned in subsection (1); b may prevent the Authority using amounts to make payments in respect of costs of a specified description. Information 32J 1 A renewables obligation order may provide for the Authority to require\u2014 a an electricity supplier to provide the Authority with information, or with information of a particular kind, which in the Authority's opinion is relevant to the question whether the supplier is discharging, or has discharged, its renewables obligation; b a person to provide the Authority with information, or with information of a particular kind, which in the Authority's opinion is relevant to the question whether a renewables obligation certificate is, or was or will in future be, required to be issued to the person. 2 That information must be given to the Authority in whatever form it requires. 3 A renewables obligation order may\u2014 a require operators of generating stations generating electricity (wholly or partly) from biomass to give specified information, or information of a specified kind, to the Authority; b specify what, for this purpose, constitutes  \u201cbiomass\u201d; c require the information to be given in a specified form and within a specified period; d authorise or require the Authority to postpone the issue of certificates under section 32B to the operator of a generating station who fails to comply with a requirement imposed by virtue of paragraph (a) or (c) until such time as the failure is remedied; e authorise or require the Authority to refuse to issue certificates to such a person or to refuse to issue them unless the failure is remedied within a prescribed period. 4 The Authority may publish information obtained by virtue of subsection (3). 5 No person is required by virtue of this section to provide any information which the person could not be compelled to give in evidence in civil proceedings in the High Court or, in Scotland, the Court of Session. Renewables obligation order: general provision 32K 1 A renewables obligation order may\u2014 a make further provision as to the functions of the Authority in relation to the matters dealt with by the order; b make transitional provision and savings; c provide for anything falling to be calculated or otherwise determined under the order to be calculated or determined by such persons, in accordance with such procedure and by reference to such matters and to the opinion of such persons, as may be specified in the order; d make different provision for different cases or circumstances. 2 Provision made by virtue of subsection (1)(b) may, in particular, include provision about the treatment of certificates issued under section 32B before the substitution of that section by section 37 of the Energy Act 2008. 3 Provision made by virtue of subsection (1)(d) may, in particular, make\u2014 a different provision in relation to different suppliers; b different provision in relation to generating stations of different descriptions; c different provision in relation to different localities. 4 In subsection (3)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201c supplier \u201d means an electricity supplier or a Northern Ireland supplier. Renewables obligation orders: procedure 32L 1 Before making a renewables obligation order, the relevant minister must consult\u2014 a the Authority, b the Council, c the electricity suppliers to whom the proposed order would apply, d such generators of electricity from renewable sources as the relevant minister considers appropriate, and e such other persons, if any, as the relevant minister considers appropriate. 2 A renewables obligation order is not to be made by the Secretary of State unless a draft of the instrument containing it has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament. 3 A renewables obligation order is not to be made by the Scottish Ministers unless a draft of the instrument containing it has been laid before and approved by a resolution of the Scottish Parliament.
