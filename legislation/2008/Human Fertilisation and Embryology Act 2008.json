Provision to donor of information about resulting children 31ZD 1 This section applies where a person (\u201c the donor \u201d) has consented under Schedule 3 (whether before or after the coming into force of this section) to\u2014 a the use of the donor's gametes, or an embryo the creation of which was brought about using the donor's gametes, for the purposes of treatment services provided under a licence, or b the use of the donor's gametes for the purposes of non-medical fertility services provided under a licence. 2 In subsection (1)\u2014 a \u201ctreatment services\u201d do not include treatment services provided to the donor, or to the donor and another person together, and b \u201cnon-medical fertility services\u201d do not include any services involving partner-donated sperm. 3 The donor may by notice request the appropriate person to give the donor notice stating\u2014 a the number of persons of whom the donor is not a parent but would or might, but for the relevant statutory provisions, be a parent by virtue of the use of the gametes or embryos to which the consent relates, b the sex of each of those persons, and c the year of birth of each of those persons. 4 Subject to subsections (5) to (7), the appropriate person shall notify the donor whether the appropriate person holds the information mentioned in subsection (3) and, if the appropriate person does so, shall comply with the request. 5 The appropriate person need not comply with a request under subsection (3) if the appropriate person considers that special circumstances exist which increase the likelihood that compliance with the request would enable the donor to identify any of the persons falling within paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (3). 6 In the case of a donor who consented as described in subsection (1)(a), the Authority need not comply with a request made to it under subsection (3) where the person who held the licence referred to in subsection (1)(a) continues to hold a licence under paragraph 1 of Schedule 2, unless the donor has previously made a request under subsection (3) to the person responsible and the person responsible\u2014 a has notified the donor that the information concerned is not held, or b has failed to comply with the request within a reasonable period. 7 In the case of a donor who consented as described in subsection (1)(b), the Authority need not comply with a request made to it under subsection (3) where the person who held the licence referred to in subsection (1)(b) continues to hold a licence under paragraph 1A of Schedule 2, unless the donor has previously made a request under subsection (3) to the person responsible and the person responsible\u2014 a has notified the donor that the information concerned is not held, or b has failed to comply with the request within a reasonable period. 8 In this section  \u201c the appropriate person \u201d means\u2014 a in the case of a donor who consented as described in paragraph (a) of subsection (1)\u2014 i where the person who held the licence referred to in that paragraph continues to hold a licence under paragraph 1 of Schedule 2, the person responsible, or ii the Authority, and b in the case of a donor who consented as described in paragraph (b) of subsection (1)\u2014 i where the person who held the licence referred to in that paragraph continues to hold a licence under paragraph 1A of Schedule 2, the person responsible, or ii the Authority. 9 In this section  \u201c the relevant statutory provisions \u201d has the same meaning as in section 31ZA. Provision of information about donor-conceived genetic siblings 31ZE 1 For the purposes of this section two relevant individuals are donor-conceived genetic siblings of each other if a person (\u201c the donor \u201d) who is not the parent of either of them would or might, but for the relevant statutory provisions, be the parent of both of them. 2 Where\u2014 a the information on the register shows that a relevant individual (\u201cA\u201d) is the donor-conceived genetic sibling of another relevant individual (\u201cB\u201d), b A has provided information to the Authority (\u201cthe agreed information\u201d) which consists of or includes information which enables A to be identified with the request that it should be disclosed to\u2014 i any donor-conceived genetic sibling of A, or ii such siblings of A of a specified description which includes B, and c the conditions in subsection (3) are satisfied, then, subject to subsection (4), the Authority shall disclose the agreed information to B. 3 The conditions referred to in subsection (2)(c) are\u2014 a that each of A and B has attained the age of 18, b that B has requested the disclosure to B of information about any donor-conceived genetic sibling of B, and c that each of A and B has been given a suitable opportunity to receive proper counselling about the implications of disclosure under subsection (2). 4 The Authority need not disclose any information under subsection (2) if it considers that the disclosure of information will lead to A or B identifying the donor unless\u2014 a the donor has consented to the donor's identity being disclosed to A or B, or b were A or B to make a request under section 31ZA(2)(a), the Authority would be required by regulations under that provision to give A or B information which would identify the donor. 5 In this section\u2014 \u201c relevant individual \u201d has the same meaning as in section 31; \u201c the relevant statutory provisions \u201d has the same meaning as in section 31ZA. Power of Authority to keep voluntary contact register 31ZF 1 In this section and section 31ZG, a  \u201c voluntary contact register \u201d means a register of persons who have expressed their wish to receive information about any person to whom they are genetically related as a consequence of the provision to any person of treatment services in the United Kingdom before 1 August 1991. 2 The Authority may\u2014 a set up a voluntary contact register in such manner as it thinks fit, b keep a voluntary contact register in such manner as it thinks fit, c determine criteria for eligibility for inclusion on the register and the particulars that may be included, d charge a fee to persons who wish their particulars to be entered on the register, e arrange for samples of the DNA of such persons to be analysed at their request, f make such arrangements as it thinks fit for the disclosure of information on the register between persons who appear to the Authority to be genetically related, and g impose such conditions as it thinks fit to prevent a person (\u201cA\u201d) from disclosing information to a person to whom A is genetically related (\u201cB\u201d) where that information would identify any person who is genetically related to both A and B. 3 The Authority may make arrangements with any person by whom a voluntary contact register is kept before the commencement of this section for the supply by that person to the Authority of the information contained in the register maintained by that person. Financial assistance for person setting up or keeping voluntary contact register 31ZG 1 The Authority may, instead of keeping a voluntary contact register, give financial assistance to any person who sets up or keeps a voluntary contact register. 2 Financial assistance under subsection (1) may be given in any form, and in particular, may be given by way of\u2014 a grants, b loans, c guarantees, or d incurring expenditure for the person assisted. 3 Financial assistance under subsection (1) may be given on such terms and conditions as the Authority considers appropriate. 4 A person receiving assistance under subsection (1) must comply with the terms and conditions on which it is given, and compliance may be enforced by the Authority."}, {"act": "Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act
