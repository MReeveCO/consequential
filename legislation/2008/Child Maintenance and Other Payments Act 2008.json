Power to order search 39L 1 On making a curfew order, the court may order the person against whom the order is made to be searched. 2 Any money found on such a search shall, unless the court otherwise directs, be applied towards payment of the amount in respect of which the curfew order is made; and the balance (if any) shall be returned to the person searched. 3 The court shall not allow the application under subsection (2) of money found on a search under this section if it is satisfied that the money does not belong to the person searched. 4 The court may exercise the powers conferred on it by section 39K(2) and (5) without the need for an application where money found on a search under this section is applied towards payment of the amount in respect of which a curfew order is made. Monitoring of curfew orders 39M 1 A curfew order shall\u2014 a provide for a person's compliance with the requirements imposed by the order to be monitored; and b make a person specified in the order responsible for that monitoring. 2 The court may not make a curfew order unless\u2014 a it has been notified by the   Secretary of State  that arrangements for monitoring compliance with the requirements imposed by such orders are available in the area in which the place proposed to be specified in the order is situated and the notice has not been withdrawn; b it is satisfied that the necessary provision can be made under those arrangements; and c it has the consent of any person (other than the person against whom the order is to be made) whose co-operation is necessary to secure the monitoring of compliance with the requirements imposed by the order. 3 If a curfew order cannot be made because of the absence of any consent required by subsection (2)(c), the court may treat the application for the order as an application under section 40 (or, in the case of an application made to the sheriff, as an application under section 40A). 4 The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision as to\u2014 a the cases or circumstances in which the person responsible for monitoring a person's compliance with the requirements imposed by a curfew order may allow that person to be absent from the place specified in the curfew order during a period so specified; and b the requirements which may be imposed in connection with such an absence. Breaches of curfew orders 39N 1 The person responsible for monitoring a person's compliance with the requirements imposed by a curfew order, or the   Secretary of State , may apply to the court where it appears that the person subject to the requirements in question has failed to comply with\u2014 a any of those requirements; or b any requirements imposed by virtue of section 39M(4). 2 On any such application the court shall (in the presence of the person subject to the requirements in question) inquire as to whether the person has failed without reasonable excuse to comply with any of those requirements. 3 If the court is of the opinion that the person has failed without reasonable excuse to comply with any of those requirements, it may\u2014 a issue a warrant of commitment against that person; or b by order provide for the requirements imposed by the curfew order to have effect for a specified further period. 4 A warrant issued under subsection (3)(a) shall order the person against whom it is issued\u2014 a to be imprisoned for a period specified in the warrant; but b to be released (unless in custody for some other reason) on payment of the amount in respect of which the curfew order in question was made. 5 A warrant issued under subsection (3)(a) may be directed to such person or persons as the court issuing it thinks fit. 6 The power conferred by subsection (3)(b) may not be exercised so as to provide for the requirements imposed by the curfew order to have effect for a period exceeding 6 months after the making of the order under that subsection. 7 Where, following the issue of a warrant under subsection (3)(a), part of the amount specified in the curfew order is paid to any person authorised to receive it, the court may, on an application by the   Secretary of State  or the person against whom the warrant was issued\u2014 a reduce the period specified in the warrant; or b order the release of the person against whom the warrant was issued. 8 On the hearing of an application made under subsection (7) the   Secretary of State  may make representations to the court as to which of the powers conferred by that subsection it would be appropriate for the court to exercise, and the person against whom the warrant was issued may reply to those representations. Effect of custody on curfew orders and power to make curfew orders 39O 1 The court may not make a curfew order against a person at any time when the person is in custody for any reason. 2 The running of the period during which the requirements imposed by a curfew order have effect shall be suspended for the whole of any day during any part of which the person against whom the order is made is in custody for any reason. 3 If the period during which the requirements imposed by a curfew order have effect would have begun to run but for its being suspended by virtue of this section, that period shall instead begin to run with the first day when its running is no longer suspended. Power to make supplementary provision about curfew orders: England and Wales 39P 1 The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for England and Wales with respect to curfew orders. 2 The regulations may, in particular, make provision\u2014 a as to the form and content of a curfew order; b allowing an application for a curfew order to be renewed where no curfew order is made; c that a statement in writing to the effect that wages of any amount have been paid during any period to a person, purporting to be signed by or on behalf of that person's employer, shall be evidence of the facts stated; d that a justice of the peace may issue a summons to a person to appear before a magistrates' court and (if that person does not appear) may issue a warrant for that person's arrest; e that, for the purpose of securing a person's presence before a magistrates' court, a justice of the peace may issue a warrant for that person's arrest without issuing a summons; f as to the execution of a warrant for arrest; g for the amendment or revocation of requirements imposed by a curfew order, on an application made to a magistrates' court by the   Secretary of State  or the person against whom the order was made; h similar to that made by sections 39J, 39L and 39M(2) and (3), in relation to any amendment of a curfew order; i as to the exercise by a magistrates' court of the powers conferred by sections 39K(2) and (3) and 39N(7). 3 Regulations under subsection (2)(g) may confer power on a magistrates' court to substitute for the place or places specified in the order a place or places in Scotland. 4 Where a magistrates' court exercises such a power, the functions of the magistrates' court in relation to the order as so amended shall be exercisable instead by the sheriff. Power to make supplementary provision about curfew orders: Scotland 39Q 1 The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for Scotland with respect to curfew orders. 2 The regulations may, in particular, make provision\u2014 a as to the content of a curfew order; b that a statement in writing to the effect that wages of any amount have been paid during any period to a person, purporting to be signed by or on behalf of that person's employer, shall be sufficient evidence of the facts stated; c for the amendment or revocation of requirements imposed by a curfew order, on an application made to the sheriff by the   Secretary of State  or the person against whom the order was made; d similar to that made by sections 39J, 39L and 39M(2) and (3), in relation to any amendment of a curfew order; e as to the exercise by the sheriff of the powers conferred by sections 39K(2) and (3) and 39N(7). 3 Regulations under subsection (2)(c) may confer power on the sheriff to substitute for the place or places specified in the order a place or places in England and Wales. 4 Where the sheriff exercises such a power, the functions of the sheriff in relation to the order as so amended shall be exercisable instead by a magistrates' court. 5 The power of the Court of Session by Act of Sederunt to regulate the procedure and practice in civil proceedings in the sheriff court shall include power to make provision\u2014 a as to the form of a curfew order; b allowing an application for a curfew order to be renewed where no curfew order is made; c that the sheriff may issue a citation to a person to appear before the sheriff and (if the person does not appear) may issue a warrant for the person's arrest;
