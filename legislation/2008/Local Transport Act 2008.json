or any one of the authorities, who entered into the quality contract may, in accordance with subsections (4) to (8) and section 132D, provide a local service (an  \u201cinterim service\u201d) in place of the old service or any part of it. 3 Subsection (2) has effect notwithstanding any prohibition, restriction or limitation contained in any other enactment on the power of the authority to provide local services. 4 An authority who provide an interim service of any description must hold a  PSV  operator's licence to which no condition is attached under section 26 of the Transport Act 1985 (power of traffic commissioner to attach conditions to licence) prohibiting the authority from using vehicles under the licence to provide services of that description. 5 Subsection (6) applies

of the old service propose to enter into a quality contract for the provision of a replacement service in place of that service or (as the case may be) that part. 6 The authority, or the authorities acting jointly, must invite tenders (in accordance with section 130) for the provision of the replacement service\u2014 a as soon as reasonably practicable after the authority providing the interim

authorities acting jointly, decide to secure the provision of the replacement service under section 131 (circumstances in which quality contracts may be entered into without inviting tenders). 8 The

a the date on which the replacement service is first provided; b the date falling nine months after the date on which the interim service is first provided. 4 If the authority issue invitations to tender in pursuance of section 132C(6) within the period mentioned in subsection (2)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(but do not enter into a quality contract to provide such a replacement service within that
