Grants involving other taxes 849AD 1 This section applies if\u2014 a in a case where section 849AB applies and the licence or other right is granted by the company to a related party, the grant is at less than its market value, b in a case where that section applies and the licence or other right is granted to the company by a related party, the grant is at more than its market value, and c conditions A and B apply. 2 Condition A is that the related party\u2014 a is not a company, or b is a company in relation to which\u2014 i in a case within subsection (1)(a), the licence or other right is not a chargeable intangible asset immediately after the grant to it, or ii in a case within subsection (1)(b), the relevant asset is not a chargeable intangible asset immediately before the grant by it. 3 Condition B is that the grant of the licence or right\u2014 a gives rise to an amount to be taken into account in calculating any person's income, profits or losses for tax purposes because of a relevant provision, or b would do so apart from section 849AB(2) or (3). 4 If this section applies, section 849AB(2) and (3) does not apply in relation to the calculation referred to in subsection (3) for the purposes of any relevant provision. 5 In this section  \u201c relevant provision \u201d means\u2014 a Chapter 2 of Part 23 of CTA 2010 (matters which are distributions), except section 1000(2), and b Part 3 of ITEPA 2003 (employment income: earnings and benefits etc treated as earnings). 3 The amendments made by this section apply in relation to a grant of a licence or other right made on or after 22 November 2017, unless it is made pursuant to an obligation, under a contract, that was unconditional before that date. 4 For the purposes of subsection (3), an obligation is  \u201cunconditional\u201d if it may not be varied or extinguished by the exercise of a right (whether under the contract or otherwise)."}, {"act": "Finance Act 2018", "year": 2018, "section": "22", "section_title": "Oil activities: tariff receipts etc", "section_text": "22 1 Chapter 4 of Part 8 of CTA 2010 (oil activities: calculation of profits) is amended as follows. 2 In section 291 (corporation tax treatment of oil activities: tariff receipts etc), for subsection (9) substitute\u2014 9 In this section,  \u201c tariff receipt \u201d has the meaning given by section 291A. 10 So far as it would not otherwise be the case, anything that constitutes a tariff receipt or a tax-exempt tariffing receipt for the purposes of the Oil Taxation Act 1983 is to be treated as a  \u201c tariff receipt \u201d for the purposes of this section. 3 After section 291 (but before the italic heading preceding section 292) insert\u2014 Meaning of  \u201ctariff receipt\u201d 291A 1 A  \u201ctariff receipt\u201d of a participator in an oil field is the amount or value of any consideration received or receivable by the person in respect of\u2014 a the use of a ring fence asset, or b the provision of services or other business facilities (of whatever kind) in connection with the use, otherwise than by the participator, of a ring fence asset. 2 \u201c Ring fence asset \u201d means a qualifying asset which is, or has been, used wholly or partly for the purposes of a ring fence trade. 3 \u201c Qualifying asset \u201d means an asset other than\u2014 a land or an interest in land, or b a building or structure which\u2014 i is situated on land, and ii does not fall within any of sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) of paragraph (c) of section 3(4) of  OTA  1975 (allowable expenditure: exclusions). 4 But an amount does not constitute a tariff receipt if the amount\u2014 a is, in relation to the person giving it, expenditure in respect of interest or any other pecuniary obligation incurred in obtaining a loan or any other form of credit, b is referable to the use of a qualifying asset for, or the provision of services or facilities in connection with, deballasting, or c is referable to other use of an asset, except use wholly or partly for an oil purpose. 5 Any consideration which includes an amount within subsection (4)(a) to (c) is to be apportioned in a just and reasonable manner. 6 In subsection (4)(c), the reference to use of an asset for an oil purpose is a reference to\u2014 a use in connection with an oil field (including use giving rise to receipts which, for the purposes of this Part, are tariff receipts), and b use for any other purpose (apart from a purpose falling within section 3(1)(b) of OTA 1975 (allowable expenditure: payment in connection with a relevant licence)) of a separate trade consisting of oil-related activities.
