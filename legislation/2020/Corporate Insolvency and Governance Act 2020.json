Eligible companies A2 Schedule ZA1 contains provision for determining whether a company is an eligible company for the purposes of this Part. CHAPTER 2 Obtaining a moratorium Obtaining a moratorium by filing or lodging documents at court A3 1 This section applies to an eligible company that\u2014 a is not subject to an outstanding winding-up petition, and b is not an overseas company. 2 The directors of the company may obtain a moratorium for the company by filing the relevant documents with the court (for the relevant documents, see section A6). 3 For the purposes of this Chapter a company is  subject to an outstanding winding-up petition if\u2014 a a petition for the winding up of the company has been presented, and b the petition has not been withdrawn or determined. Obtaining a moratorium for company subject to winding-up petition A4 1 This section applies to an eligible company that is subject to an outstanding winding-up petition. 2 The directors of the company may apply to the court for a moratorium for the company. 3 The application must be accompanied by the relevant documents (for the relevant documents, see section A6). 4 On hearing the application the court may\u2014 a make an order that the company should be subject to a moratorium, or b make any other order which the court thinks appropriate. 5 The court may make an order under subsection (4)(a) only if it is satisfied that a moratorium for the company would achieve a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being subject to a moratorium). Obtaining a moratorium for other overseas companies A5 1 This section applies to an eligible company that\u2014 a is not subject to an outstanding winding-up petition, and b is an overseas company. 2 The directors of the company may apply to the court for a moratorium for the company. 3 The application must be accompanied by the relevant documents (for the relevant documents, see section A6). 4 On hearing the application the court may\u2014 a make an order that the company should be subject to a moratorium, or b make any other order which the court thinks appropriate. The relevant documents A6 1 For the purposes of this Chapter,  the relevant documents are\u2014 a a notice that the directors wish to obtain a moratorium, b a statement from a qualified person (the proposed monitor) that the person\u2014 i is a qualified person, and ii consents to act as the monitor in relation to the proposed moratorium, c a statement from the proposed monitor that the company is an eligible company, d a statement from the directors that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and e a statement from the proposed monitor that, in the proposed monitor's view, it is likely that a moratorium for the company would result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. 2 Where it is proposed that more than one person should act as the monitor in relation to the proposed moratorium\u2014 a each of them must make a statement under subsection (1)(b), (c) and (e), and b the statement under subsection (1)(b) must specify\u2014 i which functions (if any) are to be exercised by the persons acting jointly, and ii which functions (if any) are to be exercised by any or all of the persons. 3 The rules may make provision about the date on which a statement comprised in the relevant documents must be made. 4 The Secretary of State may by regulations amend this section for the purposes of adding to the list of documents in subsection (1). 5 Regulations under subsection (4) are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Beginning of moratorium and appointment of monitor A7 1 A moratorium for a company comes into force at the time at which\u2014 a in the case of a company to which section A3 applies, the relevant documents are filed with the court under subsection (2) of that section; b in the case of a company to which section A4 applies, an order is made under section A4(4)(a); c in the case of a company to which section A5 applies, an order is made under section A5(4)(a). 2 On the coming into force of a moratorium, the person or persons who made the statement mentioned in section A6(1)(b) become the monitor in relation to the moratorium. Obligations to notify where moratorium comes into force A8 1 As soon as reasonably practicable after a moratorium for a company comes into force, the directors must notify the monitor of that fact. 2 As soon as reasonably practicable after receiving a notice under subsection (1), the monitor must notify the following that a moratorium for the company has come into force\u2014 a the registrar of companies, b every creditor of the company of whose claim the monitor is aware, c in a case where the company is or has been an employer in respect of an occupational pension scheme that is not a money purchase scheme, the Pensions Regulator, and d in a case where the company is an employer in respect of such a pension scheme that is an eligible scheme within the meaning given by section 126 of the Pensions Act 2004, the Board of the Pension Protection Fund. 3 A notice under subsection (2) must specify\u2014 a when the moratorium came into force, and b when, subject to any alteration under or by virtue of any of the provisions mentioned in section A9(3) or (4), the moratorium will come to an end. 4 If the directors fail to comply with subsection (1), any director who did not have a reasonable excuse for the failure commits an offence. 5 If the monitor without reasonable excuse fails to comply with subsection (2), the monitor commits an offence. CHAPTER 3 Length of moratorium Initial period End of the moratorium A9 1 A moratorium ends at the end of the initial period unless it is extended, or comes to an end sooner, under or by virtue of a provision mentioned in subsection (3) or (4). 2 In this Chapter  the initial period, in relation to a moratorium, means the period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force. 3 For provision under or by virtue of which a moratorium is or may be extended, see\u2014 section A10 (extension by directors without creditor consent); section A11 (extension by directors with creditor consent); section A13 (extension by court on application of directors); section A14 (extension while proposal for CVA pending); section A15 (extension by court in course of other proceedings). 4 For provision under or by virtue of which the moratorium is or may be terminated, see\u2014 section A16 (termination on entry into insolvency procedure etc); section A38 (termination by monitor); section A42 or A44 (termination by court). 5 A moratorium may not be extended under a provision mentioned in subsection (3) once it has come to an end. 6 Where the application of two or more of the provisions mentioned in subsections (3) and (4) would produce a different length of moratorium, the provision that applies last is to prevail (irrespective of whether that results in a shorter or longer moratorium). Extension of moratorium Extension by directors without creditor consent A10 1 During the initial period, but after the first 15 business days of that period, the directors may extend the moratorium by filing with the court\u2014 a a notice that the directors wish to extend the moratorium, b a statement from the directors that all of the following that have fallen due have been paid or otherwise discharged\u2014 i moratorium debts, and ii pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday during the moratorium (see section A18), c a statement from the directors that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its pre-moratorium debts, and d a statement from the monitor that, in the monitor's view, it is likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. 2 The rules may make provision about the date on which a statement mentioned in subsection (1) must be made. 3 On the filing with the court of the documents mentioned in subsection (1), the moratorium is extended so that it ends at the end of the period\u2014 a beginning immediately after the initial period ends, and b ending with the 20th business day after the initial period ends. Extension by directors with creditor consent A11 1 At any time after the first 15 business days of the initial period the directors may, if they have obtained creditor consent, extend the moratorium by filing with the court\u2014 a a notice that the directors wish to extend the moratorium, b a statement from the directors that all of the following that have fallen due have been paid or otherwise discharged\u2014 i moratorium debts, and ii pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday during the moratorium (see section A18), c a statement from the directors that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its pre-moratorium debts, d a statement from the monitor that, in the monitor's view, it is likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern, and e a statement from the directors that creditor consent has been obtained, and of the revised end date for which that consent was obtained. 2 The rules may make provision about the date on which a statement mentioned in subsection (1) must be made. 3 On the filing with the court of the documents mentioned in subsection (1), the moratorium is extended so that it ends with the revised end date mentioned in the statement under subsection (1)(e). 4 A moratorium may be extended under this section more than once. Creditor consent for the purposes of section A11 A12 1 References in section A11 to creditor consent are to the consent of pre-moratorium creditors to a revised end date for the moratorium. 2 The decision as to consent is to be made using a qualifying decision procedure. 3 The revised end date must be a date before the end of the period of one year beginning with the first day of the initial period. 4 In this section  pre-moratorium creditor means a creditor in respect of a pre-moratorium debt\u2014 a for which the company has a payment holiday during the moratorium (see section A18), and b which has not been paid or otherwise discharged. 5 In determining for the purposes of subsection (4) what counts as a pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday during the moratorium, sections A18(3) and A53(1)(b) apply as if the references to the moratorium were to the moratorium as proposed to be extended. 6 The Secretary of State may by regulations amend this section for the purposes of changing the definition of  pre-moratorium creditor. 7 Regulations under subsection (6) are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Extension by court on application of directors A13 1 At any time after the first 15 business days of the initial period, the directors may apply to the court for an order that the moratorium be extended. 2 The application must be accompanied by\u2014 a a statement from the directors that all of the following that have fallen due have been paid or otherwise discharged\u2014 i moratorium debts, and ii pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday during the moratorium (see section A18), b a statement from the directors that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its pre-moratorium debts, c a statement from the directors as to whether pre-moratorium creditors (as defined by section A12(4) and (5)) have been consulted about the application and if not why not, and d a statement from the monitor that, in the monitor's view, it is likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. 3 The rules may make provision about the date on which a statement mentioned in subsection (2) must be made. 4 On hearing the application the court may\u2014 a make an order that the moratorium be extended to such date as is specified in the order, or b make any other order which the court thinks appropriate. 5 In deciding whether to make an order under subsection (4)(a) the court must, in particular, consider the following\u2014 a the interests of pre-moratorium creditors, as defined by section A12(4) and (5), and b the likelihood that the extension of the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. 6 Subsection (7) applies where\u2014 a an application under this section is made, and b apart from that subsection, the moratorium would end at a time before the application has been disposed of. 7 The moratorium\u2014 a does not end at the time mentioned in subsection (6)(b), and b instead, ends\u2014 i in a case in which the court makes an order under subsection (4)(a), in accordance with the order; ii otherwise, when the application is withdrawn or disposed of. 8 A moratorium may be extended under this section more than once. Extension while proposal for CVA pending A14 1 Subsection (2) applies where\u2014 a at any time, the directors make a proposal under Part 1 (company voluntary arrangements), and b apart from that subsection, the moratorium would end at a time before the proposal is disposed of. 2 The moratorium\u2014 a does not end at the time mentioned in subsection (1)(b), and b instead, ends when the proposal is disposed of. 3 For the purposes of this section a proposal under Part 1 is  disposed of when any of the following takes place\u2014 a the company and its creditors both decide under section 4 not to approve the voluntary arrangement contained in the proposal; b the decisions taken by the company and its creditors under section 4 differ, and\u2014 i the period for making an application under section 4A(3) expires and either no application has been made within that period or any application made within that period has been withdrawn, or ii an application is made under section 4A(3) and that application is disposed of, or it is withdrawn after the expiry of the period for making an application under section 4A(3); c the voluntary arrangement contained in the proposal takes effect under section 5; d the proposal is withdrawn. Extension by court in the course of other proceedings A15 1 Subsection (2) applies where\u2014 a an application is made under section 896 or 901C(1) of the Companies Act 2006 (arrangements and reconstructions: court order for holding of meeting) in respect of a company, and b during proceedings before a court in connection with the application, a moratorium for the company is in force. 2 The court may make an order that the moratorium be extended to such date as is specified in the order. Early termination on certain grounds Company enters into insolvency procedure etc A16 1 A moratorium comes to an end at any time at which the company\u2014 a enters into a compromise or arrangement (see subsection (2)), or b enters into a relevant insolvency procedure (see subsection (3)). 2 For the purposes of this section a company enters into a compromise or arrangement if an order under section 899 or 901F of the Companies Act 2006 (court sanction for compromise or arrangement) comes into effect in relation to the company. 3 For the purposes of this section a company enters into a relevant insolvency procedure if\u2014 a a voluntary arrangement takes effect under section 5 in relation to the company, b the company enters administration (within the meaning of Schedule B1 (see paragraph 1(2)(b) of that Schedule)), c paragraph 44 of Schedule B1 (administration: interim moratorium) begins to apply in relation to the company, or d the company goes into liquidation (see section 247). Obligations to notify change in end of moratorium Obligations to notify change in end of moratorium A17 1 The table imposes obligations on the directors of a company to notify the monitor where a moratorium for the company is extended or comes to an end.

Restrictions on disposal of property A29 1 During a moratorium, the company may dispose of its property only if authorised by subsection (2) or (5). 2 In the case of property that is not subject to a security interest, the company may dispose of the property if\u2014 a the disposal is made in the ordinary way of the company's business, b the monitor consents, or c the disposal is in pursuance of a court order. 3 The monitor may give consent under subsection (2)(b) only if the monitor thinks that it will support the rescue of the company as a going concern. 4 In deciding whether to give consent under subsection (2)(b), the monitor is entitled to rely on information provided by the company unless the monitor has reason to doubt its accuracy. 5 In the case of property that is subject to a security interest, the company may dispose of the property if the disposal is in accordance with\u2014 a section A31(1), or b the terms of the security. 6 If the company disposes of its property during the moratorium otherwise than as authorised by this section\u2014 a the company commits an offence, and b any officer of the company who without reasonable excuse authorised or permitted the disposal commits an offence. Restrictions on disposal of hire-purchase property A30 1 During a moratorium, the company may dispose of any goods in the possession of the company under a hire-purchase agreement only if the disposal is in accordance with \u2014 a section A32(1), or b the terms of the agreement. 2 If the company disposes of goods in the possession of the company under a hire-purchase agreement otherwise than as authorised by subsection (1)\u2014 a the company commits an offence, and b any officer of the company who without reasonable excuse authorised or permitted the disposal commits an offence. Disposals of property free from charges etc Disposal of charged property free from charge A31 1 During a moratorium, the company may, with the permission of the court, dispose of property which is subject to a security interest as if it were not subject to the security interest. 2 The court may give permission under subsection (1) only if the court thinks that it will support the rescue of the company as a going concern. 3 Where the court gives permission under subsection (1) other than in relation to a floating charge, the company must apply the following towards discharging the sums secured\u2014 a the net proceeds of disposal of the property, and b any money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realised on a sale of the property in the open market by a willing vendor. 4 Where the permission relates to two or more security interests, the condition in subsection (3) requires the application of money in the order of the priorities of the security interests. 5 Where property subject to a floating charge is disposed of under subsection (1), the holder of the floating charge has the same priority in respect of acquired property as they had in respect of the property disposed of. 6 In subsection (5)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t acquired property means property of the company which directly or indirectly represents the property disposed of. 7 Where the court makes an order giving permission under subsection (1), the directors must, within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the order, send a copy of it to the registrar of companies. 8 If the directors fail to comply with subsection (7), any director who did not have a reasonable excuse for the failure commits an offence. 9 Where property in Scotland is disposed of under subsection (1), the company must grant to the disponee an appropriate document of transfer or conveyance of the property, and\u2014 a that document, or b recording, intimation or registration of that document (where recording, intimation or registration of the document is a legal requirement for completion of title to the property), has the effect of disencumbering the property of or, as the case may be, freeing the property from, the security interest. 10 If a company fails to comply with subsection (3) or (9)\u2014 a the company commits an offence, and b any officer of the company who without reasonable excuse authorised or permitted the failure commits an offence. 11 Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to any property which is subject to a financial collateral arrangement, a market charge, a system-charge or a collateral security (as defined by section A27). Disposal of hire-purchase property A32 1 During a moratorium, the company may, with the permission of the court, dispose of goods which are in the possession of the company under a hire-purchase agreement as if all of the rights of the owner under the agreement were vested in the company. 2 The court may give permission under subsection (1) only if the court thinks that it will support the rescue of the company as a going concern. 3 Where the court gives permission under subsection (1), the company must apply the following towards discharging the sums payable under the hire-purchase agreement\u2014 a the net proceeds of disposal of the goods, and b any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realised on a sale of the goods in the open market by a willing vendor. 4 If a company fails to comply with subsection (3)\u2014 a the company commits an offence, and b any officer of the company who without reasonable excuse authorised or permitted the failure commits an offence. 5 Where the court makes an order giving permission under subsection (1), the directors must, within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the order, send a copy of it to the registrar of companies. 6 If the directors fail to comply with subsection (5), any director who did not have a reasonable excuse for the failure commits an offence. 7 In Scotland, where goods in the possession of the company under a hire-purchase agreement are disposed of under subsection (1), the disposal has the effect of extinguishing, as against the disponee, all rights of the owner of the goods under the agreement. Effect of contravention of certain provisions of Chapter Contravention of certain requirements imposed under this Chapter A33 The fact that a company contravenes section A19 or any of sections A25 to A32 does not\u2014 a make any transaction void or unenforceable, or b affect the validity of any other thing. CHAPTER 5 The monitor Status of monitor A34 The monitor in relation to a moratorium is an officer of the court. Monitoring A35 1 During a moratorium, the monitor must monitor the company's affairs for the purpose of forming a view as to whether it remains likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. 2 In forming the view mentioned in subsection (1), the monitor is entitled to rely on information provided by the company, unless the monitor has reason to doubt its accuracy. Provision of information to monitor A36 1 The monitor may require the directors of the company to provide any information required by the monitor for the purpose of carrying out the monitor's functions. 2 The directors must comply with a requirement to provide information as soon as practicable. 3 For the potential consequences of failing to comply with a requirement to provide information, see section A38. Application by monitor for directions A37 The monitor in relation to a moratorium may apply to the court for directions about the carrying out of the monitor's functions. Termination of moratorium by monitor A38 1 The monitor must bring a moratorium to an end by filing a notice with the court if\u2014 a the monitor thinks that the moratorium is no longer likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going concern, b the monitor thinks that the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern has been achieved, c the monitor thinks that, by reason of a failure by the directors to comply with a requirement under section A36, the monitor is unable properly to carry out the monitor's functions, or d the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay any of the following that have fallen due\u2014 i moratorium debts; ii pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday during the moratorium (see section A18). 2 The rules may provide for debts that are to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection (1)(d). 3 On the filing with the court of a notice under subsection (1), the moratorium comes to an end. 4 The rules may make provision about the timing of a notice required to be given under subsection (1). 5 The Secretary of State may by regulations amend this section for the purposes of changing the circumstances in which the monitor must bring a moratorium to an end under subsection (1). 6 Regulations under subsection (5) are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. 7 See also section A17 (obligations to notify change in end of moratorium). Replacement of monitor or appointment of additional monitor A39 1 The court may make an order authorising the appointment of a qualified person to act as the monitor in relation to a moratorium instead of, or in addition to, a person who already acts as the monitor. 2 The court may make an order providing that a person ceases to act as the monitor in relation to a moratorium. 3 An order under subsection (1) or (2) may be made only on an application by the directors or the monitor. 4 The court may make an order authorising the appointment of a monitor under subsection (1) only if the person has provided the court with a statement that the person\u2014 a is a qualified person, and b consents to act as the monitor in relation to the moratorium. 5 Where it is proposed that more than one person should act as the monitor in relation to the moratorium, the statement under subsection (4) must specify\u2014 a which functions (if any) are to be exercised by the persons acting jointly, and b which functions (if any) are to be exercised by any or all of the persons. 6 The rules may make provision about the date on which the statement under subsection (4) must be made. 7 Where the court makes an order under subsection (1) or (2) the person begins to act as the monitor, or ceases to act as the monitor, in relation to the moratorium at the time specified in, or determined in accordance with, the order (the relevant time). 8 As soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant time, the monitor must notify the following of the effect of the order\u2014 a the registrar of companies, b every creditor of the company of whose claim the monitor is aware, c in a case where the company is or has been an employer in respect of an occupational pension scheme that is not a money purchase scheme, the Pensions Regulator, and d in a case where the company is an employer in respect of such a pension scheme that is an eligible scheme within the meaning given by section 126 of the Pensions Act 2004, the Board of the Pension Protection Fund. 9 If the monitor without reasonable excuse fails to comply with subsection (8), the monitor commits an offence. Application of Part where two or more persons act as monitor A40 1 Where two or more persons act jointly as the monitor\u2014 a a reference in this Act to the monitor is a reference to those persons acting jointly; b where an offence of omission is committed by the monitor, each of the persons appointed to act jointly\u2014 i commits the offence, and ii may be proceeded against and punished individually. 2 Where persons act jointly in respect of only some of the functions of the monitor, subsection (1) applies only in relation to those functions. 3 Where two or more persons act concurrently as the monitor a reference in this Act to the monitor is a reference to any of the persons appointed (or any combination of them). Presumption of validity A41 An act of the monitor is valid in spite of a defect in the monitor's appointment or qualification. CHAPTER 6 Challenges Challenge to monitor's actions A42 1 Any of the persons specified below may apply to the court on the ground that an act, omission or decision of the monitor during a moratorium has unfairly harmed the interests of the applicant. 2 The persons who may apply are\u2014 a a creditor, director or member of the company, or b any other person affected by the moratorium. 3 An application under subsection (1) may be made during the moratorium or after it has ended. 4 On an application under subsection (1) the court may\u2014 a confirm, reverse or modify any act or decision of the monitor, b give the monitor directions, or c make such other order as it thinks fit (but may not, under this paragraph, order the monitor to pay any compensation). 5 Where an application under subsection (1) relates to a failure by the monitor to bring the moratorium to an end under section A38(1), an order under subsection (4) may, in particular, bring the moratorium to an end and make such consequential provision as the court thinks fit. 6 Where an application under subsection (1) relates to the monitor bringing a moratorium to an end under section A38(1), an order under subsection (4) may, in particular, provide that the moratorium is not to be taken into account for the purposes of paragraph 2(1)(b) of Schedule ZA1 (company not eligible for moratorium if moratorium in force within previous 12 months). 7 In making an order under subsection (4) the court must have regard to the need to safeguard the interests of persons who have dealt with the company in good faith and for value. 8 See also section A17 (obligations to notify change in end of moratorium). Challenges to monitor remuneration in insolvency proceedings A43 1 The rules may confer on an administrator or liquidator of a company the right to apply to the court on the ground that remuneration charged by the monitor in relation to a prior moratorium for the company was excessive. 2 Rules under subsection (1) may (among other things) make provision as to\u2014 a time limits; b disposals available to the court; c the treatment of costs (or, in Scotland, the expenses) of the application in the administration or winding up. Challenge to directors' actions A44 1 A creditor or member of a company may apply to the court for an order under this section on the ground that\u2014 a during a moratorium, the company's affairs, business and property are being or have been managed by the directors in a manner which has unfairly harmed the interests of its creditors or members generally or of some part of its creditors or members (including at least the applicant), or b any actual or proposed act or omission of the directors during a moratorium causes or would cause such harm. 2 An application under subsection (1) may be made during the moratorium or after it has ended. 3 On an application under subsection (1) the court may make such order as it thinks fit. 4 An order under subsection (3) may in particular\u2014 a regulate the management by the directors of the company's affairs, business and property during the remainder of the moratorium, b require the directors to refrain from doing or continuing an act complained of by the applicant or to do an act which the applicant has complained they have omitted to do, c require a decision of the company's creditors to be sought (using a qualifying decision procedure) on such matters as the court may direct, or d bring the moratorium to an end and make such consequential provision as the court thinks fit. 5 In making an order under subsection (3) the court must have regard to the need to safeguard the interests of persons who have dealt with the company in good faith and for value. 6 See also section A17 (obligations to notify change in end of moratorium). Challenge brought by Board of the Pension Protection Fund A45 1 This section applies where\u2014 a a moratorium\u2014 i is in force in relation to a company that is an employer in respect of an eligible scheme, or ii is or has been in force in relation to a company that has been an employer in respect of an eligible scheme at any time during the moratorium, and b the trustees or managers of the scheme are a creditor of the company. 2 The Board of the Pension Protection Fund may make any application under section A42(1) or A44(1) that could be made by the trustees or managers as a creditor. 3 For the purposes of such an application, any reference in section A42(1) or A44(1) to the interests of the applicant is to be read as a reference to the interests of the trustees or managers as a creditor. 4 In this section  eligible scheme has the meaning given by section 126 of the Pensions Act 2004. CHAPTER 7 Offences: general Offence of fraud etc during or in anticipation of moratorium A46 1 An officer of a company commits an offence if, during a moratorium for the company or at any time within the period of 12 months ending with the day on which a moratorium for the company comes into force, the officer\u2014 a does any of the things mentioned in subsection (2), or b was privy to the doing by others of any of the things mentioned in subsection (2)(c), (d) and (e). 2 Those things are\u2014 a concealing any part of the company's property to the value of \u00a3500 or more, or concealing any debt due to or from the company, b fraudulently removing any part of the company's property to the value of \u00a3500 or more, c concealing, destroying, mutilating or falsifying any document affecting or relating to the company's property or affairs, d making any false entry in any document affecting or relating to the company's property or affairs, e fraudulently parting with, altering or making any omission in any document affecting or relating to the company's property or affairs, or f pawning, pledging or disposing of any property of the company which has been obtained on credit and has not been paid for (unless the pawning, pledging or disposal was in the ordinary way of the company's business). 3 It is a defence\u2014 a for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) in respect of any of the things mentioned in subsection (2)(a) or (f) to prove that the person had no intent to defraud, and b for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) in respect of any of the things mentioned in subsection (2)(c) or (d) to prove that the person had no intent to conceal the state of affairs of the company or to defeat the law. 4 Where a person pawns, pledges or disposes of any property of a company in circumstances which amount to an offence under subsection (1), every person who takes in pawn or pledge, or otherwise receives, the property commits an offence if the person knows it to be pawned, pledged or disposed of in circumstances which\u2014 a amount to an offence under subsection (1), or b would, if a moratorium were obtained for the company within the period of 12 months beginning with the day on which the pawning, pledging or disposal took place, amount to an offence under subsection (1). 5 In this section,  officer includes a shadow director. Offence of false representation etc to obtain a moratorium A47 1 An officer of a company commits an offence if, for the purpose of obtaining a moratorium for the company or an extension of a moratorium for the company, the officer\u2014 a makes any false representation, or b fraudulently does, or omits to do, anything. 2 Subsection (1) applies even if no moratorium or extension is obtained. 3 In this section,  officer includes a shadow director. Prosecution of delinquent officers of company A48 1 This section applies where a moratorium has been obtained for a company. 2 If it appears to the monitor that any past or present officer of the company has committed an offence in connection with the moratorium, the monitor must forthwith\u2014 a report the matter to the appropriate authority, and b provide the appropriate authority with such information and give the authority such access to and facilities for inspecting and taking copies of documents (being information or documents in the possession or under the control of the monitor and relating to the matter in question) as the authority requires. 3 In subsection (2),  the appropriate authority\u2014 a in the case of a company registered in England and Wales, means the Secretary of State, b in the case of a company registered in Scotland, means the Lord Advocate, and c in the case of an unregistered company means\u2014 i if it has a principal place of business in England and Wales but not Scotland, the Secretary of State, ii if it has a principal place of business in Scotland but not England and Wales, the Lord Advocate, iii if it has a principal place of business in both England and Wales and Scotland, the Secretary of State and the Lord Advocate, and iv if it does not have a principal place of business in England and Wales or Scotland, the Secretary of State. 4 Where a matter is reported to the Secretary of State under subsection (2), the Secretary of State may, for the purpose of investigating the matter and such other matters relating to the affairs of the company as appear to the Secretary of State to require investigation, exercise any of the powers which are exercisable by inspectors appointed under section 431 or 432 of the Companies Act 1985. 5 For the purpose of such an investigation any obligation imposed on a person by any provision of the Companies Acts to produce documents or give information to, or otherwise to assist, inspectors so appointed is to be regarded as an obligation similarly to assist the Secretary of State in the Secretary of State's investigation. 6 Where a question is put to a person in exercise of the powers conferred by subsection (4), the person's answer may be used in evidence against them. 7 However, in criminal proceedings in which the person is charged with an offence other than a false statement offence\u2014 a no evidence relating to the answer may be adduced, and b no question relating to it may be asked, by or on behalf of the prosecution, unless evidence relating to it is adduced, or a question relating to it is asked, in the proceedings by or on behalf of the person. 8 In subsection (7)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t false statement offence means\u2014 a an offence under section 2 or 5 of the Perjury Act 1911 (false statements made on oath otherwise than in judicial proceedings or made otherwise than on oath), or b an offence under section 44(1) or (2) of the Criminal Law (Consolidation)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Scotland) Act 1995 (false statements made on oath or otherwise than on oath). 9 Where a prosecuting authority institutes criminal proceedings following any report under subsection (2), the monitor, and every officer and agent of the company past and present (other than the defendant or defender), must give the authority all assistance in connection with the prosecution which they are reasonably able to give. 10 For this purpose\u2014 agent includes any banker or solicitor of the company and any person employed by the company as auditor, whether that person is or is not an officer of the company; prosecuting authority means the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Lord Advocate or the Secretary of State. 11 The court may, on the application of the prosecuting authority, direct a person who has failed to comply with subsection (9) to comply with it.

Obtaining a moratorium for other overseas companies   13BB    1   This Article applies to an eligible company that\u2014   a   is not subject to an outstanding winding-up petition, and     b   is an overseas company.       2   The directors of the company may apply to the High Court for a moratorium for the company.     3   The application must be accompanied by the relevant documents (for the relevant documents, see Article  13BC ).     4   On hearing the application the Court may\u2014   a   make an order that the company should be subject to a moratorium, or     b   make any other order which the Court thinks appropriate.

Beginning of moratorium and appointment of monitor   13BD    1   A moratorium for a company comes into force at the time at which\u2014   a   in the case of a company to which Article  13B  applies, the relevant documents are filed with the High Court under paragraph  (2)  of that Article;     b   in the case of a company to which Article  13BA  applies, an order is made under Article  13BA (4)(a) ;     c   in the case of a company to which Article  13BB  applies, an order is made under Article  13BB (4)(a) .       2   On the coming into force of a moratorium, the person or persons who made the statement mentioned in Article  13BC (1)(b)  become the monitor in relation to the moratorium.        Obligations to notify where moratorium comes into force   13BE    1   As soon as reasonably practicable after a moratorium for a company comes into force, the directors must notify the monitor of that fact.     2   As soon as reasonably practicable after receiving a notice under paragraph  (1) , the monitor must notify the following that a moratorium for the company has come into force\u2014   a   the registrar,     b   every creditor of the company of whose claim the monitor is aware,     c   in a case where the company is or has been an employer in respect of an occupational pension scheme that is not a money purchase scheme, the Pensions Regulator, and     d   in a case where the company is an employer in respect of such a pension scheme that is an eligible scheme within the meaning given by Article 110 of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 2005, the Board of the Pension Protection Fund.       3   A notice under paragraph  (2)  must specify\u2014   a   when the moratorium came into force, and     b   when, subject to any alteration under or by virtue of any of the provisions mentioned in Article  13C (3)  or  (4) , the moratorium will come to an end.       4   If the directors fail to comply with paragraph  (1) , any director who did not have a reasonable excuse for the failure commits an offence.     5   If the monitor without reasonable excuse fails to comply with paragraph  (2) , the monitor commits an offence.         CHAPTER 3  Length of moratorium   Initial period   End of the moratorium   13C    1   A moratorium ends at the end of the initial period unless it is extended, or comes to an end sooner, under or by virtue of a provision mentioned in paragraph  (3)  or  (4) .     2   In this Chapter \u201cthe initial period\u201d, in relation to a moratorium, means the period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force.     3   For provision under or by virtue of which a moratorium is or may be extended, see\u2014     Article  13CA  (extension by directors without creditor consent);      Article  13CB  (extension by directors with creditor consent);      Article  13CD  (extension by High Court on application of directors);      Article  13CE  (extension while proposal for CVA pending);      Article  13CF  (extension by High Court in course of other proceedings).        4   For provision under or by virtue of which the moratorium is or may be terminated, see\u2014     Article  13CG  (termination on entry into insolvency procedure etc);      Article  13ED  (termination by monitor);      Article  13F  or  13FB  (termination by High Court).        5   A moratorium may not be extended under a provision mentioned in paragraph  (3)  once it has come to an end.     6   Where the application of two or more of the provisions mentioned in paragraphs  (3)  and  (4)  would produce a different length of moratorium, the provision that applies last is to prevail (irrespective of whether that results in a shorter or longer moratorium).         Extension of moratorium   Extension by directors without creditor consent   13CA    1   During the initial period, but after the first 15 business days of that period, the directors may extend the moratorium by filing with the High Court\u2014   a   a notice that the directors wish to extend the moratorium,     b   a statement from the directors that all of the following that have fallen due have been paid or otherwise discharged\u2014   i   moratorium debts, and     ii   pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday during the moratorium (see Article  13D ),       c   a statement from the directors that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its pre-moratorium debts, and     d   a statement from the monitor that, in the monitor\u2019s view, it is likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern.       2   The rules may make provision about the date on which a statement mentioned in paragraph  (1)  must be made.     3   On the filing with the Court of the documents mentioned in paragraph (1), the moratorium is extended so that it ends at the end of the period\u2014   a   beginning immediately after the initial period ends, and     b   ending with the 20th business day after the initial period ends.          Extension by directors with creditor consent   13CB    1   At any time after the first 15 business days of the initial period the directors may, if they have obtained creditor consent, extend the moratorium by filing with the High Court\u2014   a   a notice that the directors wish to extend the moratorium,     b   a statement from the directors that all of the following that have fallen due have been paid or otherwise discharged\u2014   i   moratorium debts, and     ii   pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday during the moratorium (see Article  13D ),       c   a statement from the directors that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its pre-moratorium debts,     d   a statement from the monitor that, in the monitor\u2019s view, it is likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern, and     e   a statement from the directors that creditor consent has been obtained, and of the revised end date for which that consent was obtained.       2   The rules may make provision about the date on which a statement mentioned in paragraph  (1)  must be made.     3   On the filing with the Court of the documents mentioned in paragraph  (1) , the moratorium is extended so that it ends with the revised end date mentioned in the statement under paragraph  (1)(e) .     4   A moratorium may be extended under this Article more than once.        Creditor consent for the purposes of Article  13CB   13CC    1   References in Article  13CB  to creditor consent are to the consent of pre-moratorium creditors to a revised end date for the moratorium.     2   The decision as to consent is to be made at a meeting of pre-moratorium creditors.     3   A meeting under paragraph (2)\u2014   a   is to be held at such time, date and place as the directors think fit, and     b   is to be conducted in accordance with the rules.       4   The revised end date must be a date before the end of the period of one year beginning with the first day of the initial period.     5   In this Article \u201cpre-moratorium creditor\u201d means a creditor in respect of a pre-moratorium debt\u2014   a   for which the company has a payment holiday during the moratorium (see Article  13D ), and     b   which has not been paid or otherwise discharged.       6   In determining for the purposes of paragraph  (5)  what counts as a pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday during the moratorium, Articles  13D (3)  and  13HD (1)(b)  apply as if the references to the moratorium were to the moratorium as proposed to be extended.     7   Regulations may amend this Article for the purposes of changing the definition of \u201cpre-moratorium creditor\u201d.     8   Regulations may not be made under paragraph (7) unless a draft of the regulations has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, the Assembly.        Extension by High Court on application of directors   13CD    1   At any time after the first 15 business days of the initial period, the directors may apply to the High Court for an order that the moratorium be extended.     2   The application must be accompanied by\u2014   a   a statement from the directors that all of the following that have fallen due have been paid or otherwise discharged\u2014   i   moratorium debts, and     ii   pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday during the moratorium (see Article  13D ),       b   a statement from the directors that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its pre-moratorium debts,     c   a statement from the directors as to whether pre-moratorium creditors (as defined by Article  13CC (5)  and  (6) ) have been consulted about the application and if not why not, and     d   a statement from the monitor that, in the monitor\u2019s view, it is likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern.       3   The rules may make provision about the date on which a statement mentioned in paragraph  (2)  must be made.     4   On hearing the application the Court may\u2014   a   make an order that the moratorium be extended to such date as is specified in the order, or     b   make any other order which the Court thinks appropriate.       5   In deciding whether to make an order under paragraph  (4)(a)  the Court must, in particular, consider the following\u2014   a   the interests of pre-moratorium creditors, as defined by Article  13CC (5)  and  (6) , and     b   the likelihood that the extension of the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern.       6   Paragraph  (7)  applies where\u2014   a   an application under this Article is made, and     b   apart from that paragraph, the moratorium would end at a time before the application has been disposed of.       7   The moratorium\u2014   a   does not end at the time mentioned in paragraph  (6)(b) , and     b   instead, ends\u2014   i   in a case in which the Court makes an order under paragraph  (4)(a) , in accordance with the order;     ii   otherwise, when the application is withdrawn or disposed of.         8   A moratorium may be extended under this Article more than once.        Extension while proposal for CVA pending   13CE    1   Paragraph  (2)  applies where\u2014   a   at any time, the directors make a proposal under Part 2 (company voluntary arrangements), and     b   apart from that paragraph, the moratorium would end at a time before the proposal is disposed of.       2   The moratorium\u2014   a   does not end at the time mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), and     b   instead, ends when the proposal is disposed of.       3   For the purposes of this Article a proposal under Part 2 is \u201cdisposed of\u201d when any of the following takes place\u2014   a   the company and its creditors both decide under Article 17 not to approve the voluntary arrangement contained in the proposal;     b   the decisions taken by the company and its creditors under Article 17 differ, and\u2014   i   the period for making an application under Article 17A(3) expires and either no application has been made within that period or any application made within that period has been withdrawn, or     ii   an application is made under Article 17A(3) and that application is disposed of, or it is withdrawn after the expiry of the period for making an application under Article 17A(3);       c   the voluntary arrangement contained in the proposal takes effect under Article 18;     d   the proposal is withdrawn.          Extension by High Court in the course of other proceedings   13CF    1   Paragraph  (2)  applies where\u2014   a   an application is made under section 896 or 901C(1) of the Companies Act 2006 (arrangements and reconstructions: court order for holding of meeting) in respect of a company, and     b   during proceedings before the High Court in connection with the application, a moratorium for the company is in force.       2   The High Court may make an order that the moratorium be extended to such date as is specified in the order.

Termination of moratorium by monitor   13ED    1   The monitor must bring a moratorium to an end by filing a notice with the High Court if\u2014   a   the monitor thinks that the moratorium is no longer likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going concern,     b   the monitor thinks that the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern has been achieved,     c   the monitor thinks that, by reason of a failure by the directors to comply with a requirement under Article  13EB , the monitor is unable properly to carry out the monitor\u2019s functions, or     d   the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay any of the following that have fallen due\u2014   i   moratorium debts;     ii   pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday during the moratorium (see Article  13D ).         2   The rules may provide for debts that are to be disregarded for the purposes of paragraph  (1)(d) .     3   On the filing with the Court of a notice under paragraph (1), the moratorium comes to an end.     4   The rules may make provision about the timing of a notice required to be given under paragraph (1).     5   Regulations may amend this Article for the purposes of changing the circumstances in which the monitor must bring a moratorium to an end under paragraph (1).     6   Regulations may not be made under paragraph  (5)  unless a draft of the regulations has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, the Assembly.     7   See also Article  13CH  (obligations to notify change in end of moratorium).        Replacement of monitor or appointment of additional monitor   13EE    1   The High Court may make an order authorising the appointment of a qualified person to act as the monitor in relation to a moratorium instead of, or in addition to, a person who already acts as the monitor.     2   The High Court may make an order providing that a person ceases to act as the monitor in relation to a moratorium.     3   An order under paragraph  (1)  or  (2)  may be made on only an application by the directors or the monitor.     4   The Court may make an order authorising the appointment of a monitor under paragraph  (1)  only if the person has provided the Court with a statement that the person\u2014   a   is a qualified person, and     b   consents to act as the monitor in relation to the moratorium.       5   Where it is proposed that more than one person should act as the monitor in relation to the moratorium, the statement under paragraph  (4)  must specify\u2014   a   which functions (if any) are to be exercised by the persons acting jointly, and     b   which functions (if any) are to be exercised by any or all of the persons.       6   The rules may make provision about the date on which the statement under paragraph  (4)  must be made.     7   Where the Court makes an order under paragraph  (1)  or  (2)  the person begins to act as the monitor, or ceases to act as the monitor, in relation to the moratorium at the time specified in, or determined in accordance with, the order (\u201cthe relevant time\u201d).     8   As soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant time, the monitor must notify the following of the effect of the order\u2014   a   the registrar,     b   every creditor of the company of whose claim the monitor is aware,     c   in a case where the company is or has been an employer in respect of an occupational pension scheme that is not a money purchase scheme, the Pensions Regulator, and     d   in a case where the company is an employer in respect of such a pension scheme that is an eligible scheme within the meaning given by Article 110 of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 2005, the Board of the Pension Protection Fund.       9   If the monitor without reasonable excuse fails to comply with paragraph  (8) , the monitor commits an offence.        Application of Part where two or more persons act as monitor   13EF    1   Where two or more persons act jointly as the monitor\u2014   a   a reference in this Order to the monitor is a reference to those persons acting jointly;     b   where an offence of omission is committed by the monitor, each of the persons appointed to act jointly\u2014   i   commits the offence, and     ii   may be proceeded against and punished individually.         2   Where persons act jointly in respect of only some of the functions of the monitor, paragraph  (1)  applies only in relation to those functions.     3   Where two or more persons act concurrently as the monitor a reference in this Order to the monitor is a reference to any of the persons appointed (or any combination of them).        Presumption of validity   13EG   An act of the monitor is valid in spite of a defect in the monitor\u2019s appointment or qualification.       CHAPTER 6  Challenges   Challenge to monitor\u2019s actions   13F    1   Any of the persons specified below may apply to the High Court on the ground that an act, omission or decision of the monitor during a moratorium has unfairly harmed the interests of the applicant.     2   The persons who may apply are\u2014   a   a creditor, director or member of the company, or     b   any other person affected by the moratorium.       3   An application under paragraph  (1)  may be made during the moratorium or after it has ended.     4   On an application under paragraph  (1)  the Court may\u2014   a   confirm, reverse or modify any act or decision of the monitor,     b   give the monitor directions, or     c   make such other order as it thinks fit (but may not, under this sub-paragraph, order the monitor to pay any compensation).       5   Where an application under paragraph  (1)  relates to a failure by the monitor to bring the moratorium to an end under Article  13ED (1), an order under paragraph  (4)  may, in particular, bring the moratorium to an end and make such consequential provision as the Court thinks fit.     6   Where an application under paragraph  (1)  relates to the monitor bringing a moratorium to an end under Article  13ED (1), an order under paragraph  (4)  may, in particular, provide that the moratorium is not to be taken into account for the purposes of paragraph  2(1)(b)  of Schedule ZA1 (company not eligible for moratorium if moratorium in force within previous 12 months).     7   In making an order under paragraph  (4)  the Court must have regard to the need to safeguard the interests of persons who have dealt with the company in good faith and for value.     8   See also Article  13CH  (obligations to notify change in end of moratorium).        Challenges to monitor remuneration in insolvency proceedings   13FA    1   The rules may confer on an administrator or liquidator of a company the right to apply to the High Court on the ground that remuneration charged by the monitor in relation to a prior moratorium for the company was excessive.     2   Rules under paragraph  (1)  may (among other things) make provision as to\u2014   a   time limits;     b   disposals available to the Court;     c   the treatment of costs of the application in the administration or winding up.          Challenge to directors\u2019 actions   13FB    1   A creditor or member of a company may apply to the High Court for an order under this Article on the ground that\u2014   a   during a moratorium, the company\u2019s affairs, business and property are being or have been managed by the directors in a manner which has unfairly harmed the interests of its creditors or members generally or of some part of its creditors or members (including at least the applicant), or     b   any actual or proposed act or omission of the directors during a moratorium causes or would cause such harm.       2   An application under paragraph  (1)  may be made during the moratorium or after it has ended.     3   On an application under paragraph  (1)  the Court may make such order as it thinks fit.     4   An order under paragraph  (3)  may in particular\u2014   a   regulate the management by the directors of the company\u2019s affairs, business and property during the remainder of the moratorium,     b   require the directors to refrain from doing or continuing an act complained of by the applicant or to do an act which the applicant has complained they have omitted to do,     c   require the summoning of a meeting of the company\u2019s creditors for the purpose of considering such matters as the Court may direct, or     d   bring the moratorium to an end and make such consequential provision as the Court thinks fit.       5   In making an order under paragraph  (3)  the Court must have regard to the need to safeguard the interests of persons who have dealt with the company in good faith and for value.     6   See also Article  13CH  (obligations to notify change in end of moratorium).        Challenge brought by Board of the Pension Protection Fund   13FC    1   This Article applies where\u2014   a   a moratorium\u2014   i   is in force in relation to a company that is an employer in respect of an eligible scheme, or     ii   is or has been in force in relation to a company that has been an employer in respect of an eligible scheme at any time during the moratorium, and       b   the trustees or managers of the scheme are a creditor of the company.       2   The Board of the Pension Protection Fund may make any application under Article  13F (1)  or  13FB (1)  that could be made by the trustees or managers as a creditor.     3   For the purposes of such an application, any reference in Article  13F (1)  or  13FB (1)  to the interests of the applicant is to be read as a reference to the interests of the trustees or managers as a creditor.     4   In this Article \u201celigible scheme\u201d has the meaning given by Article 110 of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 2005.         CHAPTER 7  Offences: general   Offence of fraud etc during or in anticipation of moratorium   13G    1   An officer of a company commits an offence if, during a moratorium for the company or at any time within the period of 12 months ending with the day on which a moratorium for the company comes into force, the officer\u2014   a   does any of the things mentioned in paragraph  (2) , or     b   was privy to the doing by others of any of the things mentioned in paragraph  (2)(c) ,  (d)  and  (e) .       2   Those things are\u2014   a   concealing any part of the company\u2019s property to the value of \u00a3500 or more, or concealing any debt due to or from the company,     b   fraudulently removing any part of the company\u2019s property to the value of \u00a3500 or more,     c   concealing, destroying, mutilating or falsifying any document affecting or relating to the company\u2019s property or affairs,     d   making any false entry in any document affecting or relating to the company\u2019s property or affairs,     e   fraudulently parting with, altering or making any omission in any document affecting or relating to the company\u2019s property or affairs, or     f   pawning, pledging or disposing of any property of the company which has been obtained on credit and has not been paid for (unless the pawning, pledging or disposal was in the ordinary way of the company\u2019s business).       3   It is a defence\u2014   a   for a person charged with an offence under paragraph  (1)  in respect of any of the things mentioned in paragraph  (2)(a)  or  (f)  to prove that the person had no intent to defraud, and     b   for a person charged with an offence under paragraph  (1)  in respect of any of the things mentioned in paragraph  (2)(c)  or  (d)  to prove that the person had no intent to conceal the state of affairs of the company or to defeat the law.       4   Where a person pawns, pledges or disposes of any property of a company in circumstances which amount to an offence under paragraph  (1) , every person who takes in pawn or pledge, or otherwise receives, the property commits an offence if the person knows it to be pawned, pledged or disposed of in circumstances which\u2014   a   amount to an offence under paragraph  (1) , or     b   would, if a moratorium were obtained for the company within the period of 12 months beginning with the day on which the pawning, pledging or disposal took place, amount to an offence under paragraph  (1) .       5   In this Article, \u201cofficer\u201d includes a shadow director.        Offence of false representation etc to obtain a moratorium   13GA    1   An officer of a company commits an offence if, for the purpose of obtaining a moratorium for the company or an extension of a moratorium for the company, the officer\u2014   a   makes any false representation, or     b   fraudulently does, or omits to do, anything.       2   Paragraph  (1)  applies even if no moratorium or extension is obtained.     3   In this Article, \u201cofficer\u201d includes a shadow director.        Prosecution of delinquent officers of company   13GB    1   This Article applies where a moratorium has been obtained for a company.     2   If it appears to the monitor that any past or present officer of the company has committed an offence in connection with the moratorium, the monitor must forthwith\u2014   a   report the matter to the Department, and     b   provide the Department with such information and give it such access to and facilities for inspecting and taking copies of documents (being information or documents in the possession or under the control of the monitor and relating to the matter in question) as it requires.       3   Where a matter is reported to the Department under paragraph  (2) , the Department may, for the purpose of investigating the matter and such other matters relating to the affairs of the company as appear to the Department to require investigation, exercise any of the powers which are exercisable by inspectors appointed under section 431 or 432 of the Companies Act 1985.     4   For the purpose of such an investigation any obligation imposed on a person by any provision of the Companies Acts to produce documents or give information to, or otherwise to assist, inspectors so appointed is to be regarded as an obligation similarly to assist the Department in its investigation.     5   Where a question is put to a person in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph  (3) , the person\u2019s answer may be used in evidence against them.     6   However, in criminal proceedings in which the person is charged with an offence other than a false statement offence\u2014   a   no evidence relating to the answer may be adduced, and     b   no question relating to it may be asked,    by or on behalf of the prosecution, unless evidence relating to it is adduced, or a question relating to it is asked, in the proceedings by or on behalf of the person.     7   In paragraph (6) \u201cfalse statement offence\u201d means an offence under Article 7 or 10 of the Perjury (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 ( S.I. 1979/1714 (N.I. 19) ) (false statements made on oath otherwise than in judicial proceedings or made otherwise than on oath).     8   Where the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland institutes criminal proceedings following any report under paragraph  (2) , the monitor, and every officer and agent of the company past and present (other than the defendant), must give the Director all assistance in connection with the prosecution which they are reasonably able to give.     9   For this purpose \u201cagent\u201d includes any banker or solicitor of the company and any person employed by the company as auditor, whether that person is or is not an officer of the company.     10   The High Court may, on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, direct a person who has failed to comply with paragraph  (8)  to comply with it.
