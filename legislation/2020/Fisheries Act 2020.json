change objective. 2 The  \u201csustainability objective\u201d is that\u2014 a fish and aquaculture activities are\u2014 i environmentally sustainable in the long term, and ii managed so as to achieve economic, social and employment benefits and contribute to the availability of food supplies, and b the fishing capacity of fleets is such that fleets are economically viable but do not overexploit marine stocks. 3 The  \u201cprecautionary objective\u201d is that\u2014 a the precautionary approach to fisheries management is applied, and b exploitation of marine stocks restores and maintains populations of harvested species above biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield. 4 The  \u201cecosystem objective\u201d is that\u2014 a fish and aquaculture activities are managed using an ecosystem-based approach so as to ensure that their negative impacts on marine ecosystems are minimised and, where possible, reversed, and b incidental catches of sensitive species are minimised and, where possible, eliminated. 5 The  \u201cscientific evidence objective\u201d is that\u2014 a scientific data relevant to the management of fish and aquaculture activities is collected, b where appropriate, the fisheries policy authorities work together on the collection of, and share, such scientific data, and c the management of fish and aquaculture activities is based on the best available scientific advice. 6 The  \u201cbycatch objective\u201d is that\u2014 a the catching of fish that are below minimum conservation reference size, and other bycatch, is avoided or reduced, b catches are recorded and accounted for, and c bycatch that is fish is landed, but only where this is appropriate and (in particular) does not create an incentive to catch fish that are below minimum conservation reference size. 7 The  \u201cequal access objective\u201d is that the access of UK fishing boats to any area within British fishery limits is not affected by\u2014 a the location of the fishing boat's home port, or b any other connection of the fishing boat, or any of its owners, to any place in the United Kingdom. 8 The  \u201cnational benefit objective\u201d is that fishing activities of UK fishing boats bring social or economic benefits to the United Kingdom or any part of the United Kingdom. 9 The  \u201cclimate change objective\u201d is that\u2014 a the adverse effect of fish and aquaculture activities on climate change is minimised, and b fish and aquaculture activities adapt to climate change. 10 In this section\u2014 \u201c ecosystem-based approach \u201d means an approach which\u2014 ensures that the collective pressure of human activities is kept within levels compatible with the achievement of good environmental status (within the meaning of the Marine Strategy Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1627)), and does not compromise the capacity of marine ecosystems to respond to human-induced changes; \u201c precautionary approach to fisheries management \u201d

species, non-target species or their environment."}, {"act": "Fisheries Act 2020", "year": 2020, "section": "2", "section_title": "Joint fisheries statement", "section_text": "2 1 The fisheries policy
