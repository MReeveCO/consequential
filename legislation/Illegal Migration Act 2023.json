particular migration by unsafe and illegal routes, by requiring the removal from the United Kingdom of certain persons who enter or arrive in the United Kingdom in breach of immigration control. 2 To advance that purpose, this Act\u2014 a places a duty on the Secretary of State to make arrangements for the removal of certain persons who enter or arrive in the United Kingdom in breach of immigration control as soon as is reasonably practicable after their entry or arrival, subject only to the exceptions specified by or under this Act; b provides for protection claims and certain human rights claims made by persons who meet the conditions for removal under this Act to be inadmissible; c provides for the detention of persons who are subject to removal under this Act; d provides for protections and entitlements to assistance and support which are available to victims of modern slavery or human trafficking not to apply to persons who are subject to removal under this Act; e prevents persons who meet the conditions for removal under this Act from being given leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom; f prevents persons who meet the conditions for removal under this Act from settling in the United Kingdom or obtaining citizenship; g provides a procedure for persons who are subject to removal under this Act to challenge their removal by means of a suspensive claim (as defined in section  38 ); h has the effect that all other legal challenges to the removal of persons under this Act do not suspend the duty to make arrangements for their removal. 3 Accordingly, and so far as it is possible to do so, provision made by or by virtue of this Act must be read and given effect so as to achieve the purpose mentioned in subsection  (1) . 4 In addition, this Act makes provision\u2014 a about the period for which persons may be detained in immigration detention; b for protections that apply to victims of modern slavery or human trafficking not to apply to persons who are a threat to public order or who have claimed to be victims in bad faith unless compelling circumstances apply; c for persons who have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment for an offence or who are liable to deportation to be deemed to be a threat to public order for the purposes of the disapplication of those protections; d for asylum claims and human rights claims made by nationals of certain safe States to be inadmissible; e for the maximum number of persons who may enter the United Kingdom annually using safe and legal routes to be specified in regulations which are subject to approval by Parliament; f for certain kinds of behaviour relating to an identity document or electronic information by a person who makes an asylum claim or a human rights claim to be taken into account as damaging the claimant\u2019s credibility. 5 Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (interpretation of legislation) does not apply in relation to provision made by or by virtue of this

(persons excluded from the United Kingdom under certain instruments) and\u2014 i subsection (5A) of that section (exceptions to section 8B) does not apply to the person, and ii an exception created under, or direction given by virtue of, section 15(4) of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (power to create exceptions to section 8B) does not apply to the person, d the person requires entry clearance under the immigration rules, but has arrived in the United Kingdom without a valid entry clearance, or e the person is required under immigration rules not to travel to the United Kingdom without an electronic travel authorisation that is valid for that person\u2019s journey to the United Kingdom, but has arrived in the United Kingdom without such an electronic travel authorisation. 3 The second condition is that the person entered or arrived in the United Kingdom as mentioned in subsection  (2)  on or after the day on which this Act is passed. 4 The third condition is that, in entering or arriving as mentioned in subsection  (2) , the person did not come directly to the United Kingdom from a country in which the person\u2019s life and liberty were threatened by reason of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. 5 For the purposes of subsection  (4)  a person is not to be taken to have come directly to the United Kingdom from a country in which their life and liberty were threatened as mentioned in that subsection if, in coming from such a country, they passed through or stopped in another country outside the United Kingdom where their life and liberty were not so threatened. 6 The fourth condition is that the person requires leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom but does not have it. 7 Any limited leave to enter or remain given under the immigration rules to a person within section  4 (1)  (unaccompanied children) is to be disregarded in determining whether the

the person, b regulations under section  4 (7)  (other exceptions) apply to the person, c a Minister of the Crown has made a determination under section  55 (2)  (interim measures of the European
