of the body; c that as from the specified date no recognised body or manager or employee of such a body shall, except in accordance with a Society permission, permit the person with respect to whom the order is made to have an interest in the body. 2A The Society may make regulations prescribing charges to be paid to the Society by persons who are the subject of an investigation by the Society as to whether there are grounds for the Society\u2014 a to make an order under subsection (2), or b to make an application to the Tribunal for it to make such an order. 2B Regulations under subsection (2A) may\u2014 a make different provision for different cases or purposes; b provide for the whole or part of a charge payable under the regulations to be repaid in such circumstances as may be
