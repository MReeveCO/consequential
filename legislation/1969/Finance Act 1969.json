dwelling-house as his only or main residence, or b the developing owner intends to give his assessable interest in that land to some other person who intends to occupy the dwelling-house as his only or main residence, or c where section 32(5)(b) or (c) of this Act applies to the developing owner (so that he is a prospective purchaser under an enforceable contract), the contract is to acquire for less than full consideration (so as to be partly by way of gift) and the developing owner intends to occupy the dwelling-house as his only or main residence, and the person so intending to occupy the dwelling-house is in fact the first occupier and continues in occupation for at least six months, or if earlier until his death. 2 No relief shall be given under subsection (1)(b) or (c) above unless the person intending to occupy the dwelling-house in fact acquires the assessable interest as a gift, or as a legacy, within twelve months, or such longer period as the Commission may allow, from the beginning of the project. 3 No relief shall be given under this section as respects a gift made before 1st July 1948, or as respects a legacy on a death before that date. 4 If the developing owner so elects, he shall be treated for the purposes of Case C levy in respect of the project as if he acquired the gift or legacy for capital consideration equal to its market value\u2014 a where subsection (1)(a) above applies, at the time of the gift or death, b where subsection (1)(b) or (c) above applies, at the beginning of the project, and for the purposes of Schedule 5 to this Act he shall be deemed to have acquired the gift or legacy at that time by way of a disposition to him which was the last relevant disposition. 5 In determining the market value of a gift or legacy at the time given by subsection (4) above, account shall be taken of the state of the land at that time, and of the incidents attaching to the assessable interest at that time, and of all other circumstances, including circumstances concerning planning permission, which would have been taken into account by a purchaser at that time. 6 If the time given by subsection (4) above falls between 30th June 1948 and 6th April 1967, Part V of Schedule 4 to this Act shall have effect in relation to the project as if paragraph 49 of that Schedule were omitted, and if that time does not fall between those dates, the

separate interests one of which is the subject of the gift or legacy, and all such apportionments, computations and valuations shall be made as are necessary to give effect to this subsection. 9 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a property acquired by way of gift includes property acquired for less than market value if the Land Commission are satisfied that the grantor intended to give a benefit by accepting less than market value, b property acquired as a legacy includes property appropriated in or towards satisfaction of any interest or share in property devolving under a
