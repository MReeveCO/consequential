b the bringing to an end of the apportionment takes effect on the date of registration. 12C Where it is determined under subsection (12)(b)(iii) that an apportionment of a registered common grazing is to come to an end, the apportionment comes to an end, as respects an application for registration of the bringing of it to an end by virtue of section 25 of the 2010 Act, on the date of registration. 12D But subsection (12C) does not apply to an apportionment the bringing to an end of which takes effect by virtue of subsection (12B). 13 Where\u2014 a a period of apportionment fixed under subsection (10)(a) above (or so fixed and extended under subsection (11) above) comes to anend; or b it is determined on review under subsection (10)(b) above, or is determined under subsection (12)(b)(iii) above, that anapportionment is to come to an end, the land in question reverts to being a common grazing. 14 Where land reverts under subsection (13) above, the Commission may, having regard to the rights held in the common grazing immediately before the apportionment inquestion, make such determination as they consider equitable as to shares in the common grazing. 14A Any determination under subsection (14) takes effect, as respects an application for registration of the making of the determination by virtue of section 25 of the 2010 Act, on the date of registration. 15 Subsections (10) to   (14A)   above do not apply as respects land constituted as common grazing under section 51A of this Act."}, {"act": "Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993", "year": 1993, "section": "52A", "section_title": "Appeal to Land Court: general", "section_text": "52A 1 An appeal shall lie to the Land Court, on one or more of the grounds mentioned in subsection (3) below, against\u2014 a any decision, determination or direction of;
