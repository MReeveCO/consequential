Convention Rights (Compliance)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Scotland)) Act 2001 (asp 7)) had been in force at the time when the prisoner was sentenced. 2L The court, in considering the case of a transferred life prisoner\u2014 a who is serving more than one sentence of imprisonment for life; and b two or more of whose life sentences were imposed in proceedings on a single indictment, shall, in making the order under subsection (2J) above, proceed as if the prisoner had been sentenced in Scotland and section 205D (only one sentence of imprisonment for life to be imposed in any proceedings) of the 1995 Act had been in force at the time the prisoner was sentenced. 2M Such a transferred life prisoner who, before being transferred to Scotland, had been released on licence, otherwise than on compassionate grounds, shall be deemed to have been released on licence under section 2(4) of this Act as if the transferred life prisoner had been a life prisoner to whom that section applied and who had served the punishment part of his sentence. 2N The reference in this section to a transferred life prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds has the same meaning as that reference has in section 10A of this Act. 2P The court shall pronounce the order under subsection (2J) above in open court. 2Q If the court is satisfied that the transferred life prisoner is incapable of properly instructing a solicitor in relation to the hearing under subsection (2J) above, whether or not the prisoner has so instructed a solicitor, it shall not make the order under that subsection. 2R If the Scottish Ministers are satisfied that the prisoner is no longer incapable of instructing a solicitor in relation to the hearing under subsection (2J) above, they shall, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, refer the case of the prisoner to the court for such a hearing. 2S In this section\u2014 \u201c incapable \u201d means incapable by reason of mental disorder or of inability to communicate because of physical disability; but a person shall not fall within this definition by reason only of a lack or deficiency in a faculty of communication if that lack or deficiency can be made good by human or mechanical aid (whether of an interpretative nature or otherwise); and \u201c mental disorder \u201d has the same meaning as it has in section 87 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 (asp 4). 2T Nothing in this section shall be taken as preventing a prisoner, in respect of whom the court declined, under subsection (2Q) above, to make the order under subsection (2J) above, from again referring his case for a hearing under subsection (2J) above. 2U A hearing under subsection (2J) above shall be criminal procedure for the purposes of section 305 of the 1995 Act (power of High Court of Justiciary to regulate criminal procedure by Act of Adjournal). 3 In a case to which this subsection applies   (whether by virtue of subsection (2) above or of subsection (2B) above) , this Part of this Act except  section 2(9)  shall apply as if\u2014 a the transferred life prisoner were a  . . . life prisoner within the meaning of section 2 of this Act; and b the

to in subsection (2D) above . 4 In this section \u201c transferred life prisoner \u201d means a person\u2014 a on whom a court in a country or territory outside Scotland  or a court-martial  has  (whether before or after the commencement of this section)  imposed one or more sentences of imprisonment or detention for an indeterminate period; and b who has been transferred to Scotland  , or in
