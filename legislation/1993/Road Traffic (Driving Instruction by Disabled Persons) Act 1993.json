and b such other particulars as the Secretary of State may require. 4 Where a person is required to submit himself for an emergency control assessment he must furnish to the Secretary of State such particulars as the Secretary of State may require. 5 An emergency control assessment\u2014 a shall be conducted by a person appointed by the Secretary of State (in this section referred to as \u201c the assessor \u201d); and b shall consist of such practical tests and other means of assessment as the Secretary of State may determine. 6 On completing an emergency control assessment of a person, the assessor shall grant him an emergency control certificate if he is satisfied either\u2014 a that, in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (2) above, that person would be able to take control of a motor car of a class covered by his disabled person\u2019s limited driving licence without any modifications, or b that, in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (2) above, that person would be able to take control of a motor car of a class covered by his disabled person\u2019s limited driving licence only with appropriate modifications of such a motor car; but if the assessor is not so satisfied, he shall refuse to grant a certificate to that person. 7 An emergency control certificate granted to any person\u2014 a shall specify the class of motor car covered by his disabled person\u2019s limited driving licence in relation to which the assessor is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (6)(a) or (b) above, specifying, in a case falling within paragraph (b) the modifications that are appropriate; and b may include a recommendation that that person should undergo a further emergency control assessment after the end of such period as is specified in the certificate; and shall otherwise be in such form as the Secretary of State may determine. 8 Different modifications for different classes of motor car may be specified under subsection (7)(a) above. 9 The assessor who has assessed any person under this section\u2014 a if he grants an emergency control certificate, shall\u2014 i give or send the certificate to that person, and ii send a copy of the certificate to the Registrar;

required by the Registrar to submit himself for a further assessment. 2 A person whose name is not on the register but who holds a current emergency control certificate shall, if at any time required to do so by the Registrar, submit himself for a further emergency control assessment on the day (within such period as may be prescribed by regulations) and at the place specified by the Registrar. 3 In considering whether to exercise, in respect of any person, his power under subsection (2) above, the Registrar shall have regard to any recommendation included in that person\u2019s current emergency control certificate as to the period after the end of which he should undergo a further emergency control assessment. 4 A person who\u2014 a holds a current emergency control certificate, but b wishes to undergo a further emergency control assessment with a view to establishing his ability to control any class of motor car not specified in his current certificate, may, with the consent of the Registrar and subject to subsection (1) above, apply to undergo a further assessment; but a person applying to undergo a further assessment under this subsection shall not be required to make the declaration required by section 133A(3)(a) of this Act. 5 An application made under subsection (4) above for the consent of the Registrar shall be made in such manner and be accompanied by such particulars as the Registrar may require. 6 If, as a result of undergoing a further emergency control assessment, a person is granted a fresh emergency control certificate the grant of that certificate shall, with effect from the date on which it is notified as taking effect, revoke the previous certificate. 7 If, in the case of an emergency control assessment conducted in respect of a person who holds a current emergency control certificate, the assessor is not satisfied as to either of the matters specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 133A(6), he shall revoke the certificate. 8 Where a person\u2019s emergency control certificate is revoked under subsection (7) above the assessor shall\u2014 a serve notice in writing on him specifying\u2014 i the grounds for the revocation, and ii the date, not being earlier than the date of service of the notice, on which the revocation is to take effect, and b send a copy of the notice to the Registrar. 9 In this
