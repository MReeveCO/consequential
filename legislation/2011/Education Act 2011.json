Supply of information by contractor, agency etc 141E 1 This section applies where arrangements have been made by a person (the  \u201cagent\u201d) for a teacher to carry out work at the request of or with the consent of a relevant employer (whether or not under a contract) and the agent has terminated the arrangements because the teacher has been guilty of serious misconduct. 2 This section also applies where the agent\u2014 a might have terminated the arrangements as mentioned in subsection (1) had the teacher not terminated them, or b might have refrained from making new arrangements because of the teacher's serious misconduct had the teacher not ceased to be available for work. 3 The agent must consider whether it would be appropriate to provide prescribed information about the teacher to the Secretary of State. 4 In this section  \u201c relevant employer \u201d and  \u201c teacher \u201d have the same meanings as in section 141D. 2 In EA 2002, after Schedule 11, insert\u2014 SCHEDULE 11A REGULATIONS ABOUT DECISIONS UNDER SECTION 141B Section 141B Regulations: general 1 The Secretary of State must make regulations in accordance with the following provisions of this Schedule.

Supplementary provisions 6 1 Regulations under paragraph 1 may make incidental and supplementary provision, including provision\u2014 a where a prohibition order has effect in relation to a person, for the Secretary of State to serve notice of the order on the person's employer; b requiring the employer of such a person to take such steps in consequence of the order (which may include dismissing the person) as may be prescribed; c authorising the delegation of functions conferred by virtue of this Schedule and the determination of matters by any person or persons specified in the regulations. 2 Regulations under paragraph 1 may also make provision\u2014 a for the Secretary of State to make a decision in a particular case about the effect in England of an order prohibiting a person from teaching in schools in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland;
