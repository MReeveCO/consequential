the panel, or refer any matter relating to the possible termination or variation of the requirement for its advice or recommendations; b invite the authority to make representations; and c if the authority has any functions other than Welsh devolved functions, invite the appropriate national authority to make representations, before deciding whether to terminate or vary the requirement mentioned in subsection (5). 8 If the authority makes an application under subsection (6) the Welsh Ministers may by notice to the authority suspend the requirement until further notice (but this does not affect the liability to make any payment once the suspension is ended, unless the final notice is varied to have that effect)."}, {"act": "Localism Act 2011", "year": 2011, "section": "67",

For this purpose  \u201c procedure \u201d includes all aspects of the allocation process, including the persons or descriptions of persons by whom decisions are taken. 2 The scheme must include a statement of the authority's policy on offering people who are to be allocated housing accommodation\u2014 a a choice of housing accommodation; or b the opportunity to express preferences about the housing accommodation to be allocated to them. 3 As regards priorities, the scheme shall, subject to subsection (4), be framed so as to secure that reasonable preference is given to\u2014 a people who are homeless (within the meaning of Part 7); b people who are owed a duty by any local housing authority under section 190(2), 193(2) or 195(2) (or under section 65(2) or 68(2) of the Housing Act 1985) or who are occupying accommodation secured by any such authority under section 192(3); c people occupying insanitary or overcrowded housing or otherwise living in unsatisfactory housing conditions; d people who need to move on medical or welfare grounds (including any grounds relating to a disability); and e people who need to move to a particular locality in the district of the authority, where failure to meet that need would cause hardship (to themselves or to others). The scheme may also be framed so as to give additional preference to particular descriptions of people within this subsection (being descriptions of people with urgent housing needs). 4 People are to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection (3) if they would not have fallen within paragraph (a) or (b) of that subsection without the local housing authority having had regard to a restricted person (within the meaning of Part 7). 5 The scheme may contain provision for determining priorities in allocating housing accommodation to people within subsection (3); and the factors which the scheme may allow to be taken into account include\u2014 a the financial resources available to a person to meet his housing costs; b any behaviour of a person (or of a member of his household) which affects his suitability to be a tenant; c any local connection (within the meaning of section 199) which exists between a person and the authority's district. 6 Subject to subsection (3), the scheme may contain provision about the allocation of particular housing accommodation\u2014 a to a person who makes a specific application for that accommodation; b to persons of a particular description (whether or not they are within subsection (3)). 7 The Secretary of State may by regulations\u2014 a specify further descriptions of people to whom preference is to be given as mentioned in subsection (3), or b amend or repeal any part of subsection (3). 8 The Secretary of State may by regulations specify factors which a local housing authority in England must not take into account in allocating housing accommodation. 9 The scheme must be framed so as to secure that an applicant for an allocation of housing accommodation\u2014 a has the right to request such general information as will enable him to assess\u2014 i how his application is likely to be treated under the scheme (including in particular whether he is likely to be regarded as a member of a group of people who are to be given preference by virtue of subsection (3)); and ii whether housing accommodation appropriate to his needs is likely to be made available to him and, if so, how long it is likely to be before such accommodation becomes available for allocation to him; b has the right to request the authority to inform him of any decision about the facts of his case which is likely to be, or has been, taken into account in considering whether to allocate housing accommodation to him; and c has the right to request a review of a decision mentioned in paragraph (b), or in section 160ZA(9), and to be informed of the decision on the review and the grounds for it. 10 As regards the procedure to be followed, the scheme must be framed in accordance with such principles as the Secretary of State may prescribe by regulations. 11 Subject to the above provisions, and to any regulations made under them, the authority may decide on what principles the scheme is to be framed. 12 A local housing authority in England must, in preparing or modifying their allocation scheme, have regard to\u2014 a their current homelessness strategy under section 1 of the Homelessness Act 2002, b their current tenancy strategy under section 150 of the Localism Act 2011, and c in the case of an authority that is a London borough council, the London housing strategy. 13 Before adopting an allocation scheme, or making an alteration to their scheme reflecting a major change of policy, a local housing authority in England must\u2014 a send a copy of the draft scheme, or proposed alteration, to every private registered provider of social housing and registered social landlord with which they have nomination arrangements (see section 159(4)), and b afford those persons a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposals. 14 A

flexible tenancy. 4 The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision about the procedure to be followed in connection with a review under this section. 5 The regulations may, in particular,

review. 7 If the decision is to confirm the original decision, the landlord must also notify the tenant of the reasons for the decision. 8 The review must be carried out, and the tenant notified, before the date specified in the notice of proceedings as the date after which proceedings for the possession of the dwelling-house may be begun. 9 Regulations under this section\u2014 a may contain

Planning permission to be assumed for acquiring authority's proposals 15 1 In a case where\u2014 a the relevant interest is to be acquired for purposes which involve the carrying out of proposals of the acquiring authority for development of the relevant land or part of it, and b planning permission for that development is not in force at the relevant valuation date, it is to be assumed for the purposes of section 14(2)(a) and (b)(i) and (4)(a) that planning permission is in force at the relevant valuation date for the development of the relevant land or that part of it, as the case may be, in accordance with the proposals of the acquiring authority. 2 For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), no account is to be taken of any planning permission so granted as not to enure (while the permission remains in force) for the benefit of the land and of all persons for the time being interested in the land. 3 For sections 17 and 18 (certification of appropriate alternative development and appeals against certificates) substitute\u2014 Certificates of appropriate alternative development 17 1 Where an interest in land is proposed to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers, either of the parties directly concerned may (subject to subsection (2)) apply to the local planning authority for a certificate containing whichever of the following statements is the applicable statement\u2014 a that in the local planning authority's opinion there is development that, for the purposes of section 14, is appropriate alternative development in relation to the acquisition; b that in the local planning authority's opinion there is no development that, for the purposes of section 14, is appropriate alternative development in relation to the acquisition. 2 If\u2014 a the acquiring authority have served a notice to treat in respect of the interest or an agreement has been made for the sale of the interest to that authority, and b a reference has been made to the Upper Tribunal to determine the amount of the compensation payable in respect of the interest, no application for a certificate under this section may be made after the making of that reference by either of the parties directly concerned except with the consent in writing of the other party directly concerned or the permission of the Upper Tribunal. 3 An application for a certificate under this section\u2014 a must contain whichever of the following statements is the applicable statement\u2014 i that in the applicant's opinion there is development that, for the purposes of section 14, is appropriate alternative development in relation to the acquisition concerned; ii that in the applicant's opinion there is no development that, for the purposes of section 14, is appropriate alternative development in relation to the acquisition concerned; b must, if it contains a statement under paragraph (a)(i), specify\u2014 i each description of development that in the applicant's opinion is, for the purposes of section 14, appropriate alternative development in relation to the acquisition, and ii the applicant's reasons for holding that opinion; and c must be accompanied by a statement specifying the date on which a copy of the application has been or will be served on the other party directly concerned. 4 Where an application is made to the local planning authority for a certificate under this section in respect of an interest in land, the local planning authority must not, without the agreement of the other party directly concerned, issue a certificate to the applicant before the end of 22 days beginning with the date specified in the statement under subsection (3)(c). 5 If a certificate under this section contains a statement under subsection (1)(a) it must also\u2014 a identify every description of development (whether specified in the application or not) that in the local planning authority's opinion is, for the purposes of section 14, appropriate alternative development in relation to the acquisition concerned, and b give a general indication\u2014 i of any conditions to which planning permission for the development could reasonably have been expected to be subject, ii of when the permission could reasonably have been expected to be granted if it is one that could reasonably have been expected to be granted only at a time after the relevant valuation date, and iii of any pre-condition for granting the permission (for example, entry into an obligation) that could reasonably have been expected to have to be met. 6 If a certificate under this section contains a statement under subsection (1)(a)\u2014 a then, for the purposes of section 14, development is appropriate alternative development in relation to the acquisition concerned if, and only if, it is of a description identified in accordance with subsection (5)(a) in the certificate, and b the matters indicated in accordance with subsection (5)(b) in the certificate are to be taken to apply in relation to the planning permission that under section 14(3) may be assumed to be in force for that development. 7 If a certificate under this section contains a statement under subsection (1)(b) then, for the purposes of section 14, there is no development that is appropriate alternative development in relation to the acquisition concerned. 8 References in subsections (5) to (7) to a certificate under this section include references to the certificate as varied and to any certificate issued in place of the certificate. 9 On issuing to one of the parties directly concerned a certificate under this section in respect of an interest in land, the local planning authority must serve a copy of the certificate on the other of those parties. 10 In assessing any compensation payable to any person in respect of any compulsory acquisition, there must be taken into account any expenses reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the issue of a certificate under this section (including expenses incurred in connection with an appeal under section 18 where any of the issues are determined in the person's favour). 11 For the purposes of this section and sections 18 to 20, the Broads Authority is the sole district planning authority for the Broads; and here  \u201c the Broads \u201d has the same meaning as in the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988.

for the time being entitled to that interest, or b any authority possessing compulsory purchase powers by whom that interest is proposed to be, or is, acquired, may appeal to the Upper Tribunal against that certificate. 2 On any appeal under this section against a certificate, the Upper Tribunal\u2014 a must consider the matters to which the certificate relates as if the application for a certificate under section 17 had been made to the Upper Tribunal in the first place, and b must\u2014 i confirm the certificate, or ii vary it, or iii cancel it and issue a different certificate in its place, as the Upper Tribunal may consider appropriate. 3 Where an application is made for a certificate under section 17, and at the expiry of the time prescribed by a development order for the issue of the certificate (or, if an extended period is at any time agreed upon in writing by the parties and the local planning authority, at the end of that period) no certificate has been issued by the local planning authority in accordance with that section, the preceding provisions of this section apply as if the local planning authority has issued such a certificate containing a statement under section 17(1)(b). 4 In section 20 (power to prescribe matters relevant to Part 3) omit\u2014 a in the opening words\u2014 i the words  \u201cand appeals under section eighteen of this Act\u201d,
