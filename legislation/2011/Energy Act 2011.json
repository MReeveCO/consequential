on a person who is within section 34(2)(a) of the 1998 Act only because one or more of subsections (7) to (10) applies in relation to the person. 7 This subsection applies in relation to a person if\u2014 a the person is within paragraph (b) of section 30(1) of the 1998 Act in relation to the installation only by virtue of the fact that the person had a right mentioned in section 30(5)(a) of that Act when an activity mentioned in section 30(6) of that Act was last carried on from, by means of or on the installation, and b any such activity was last so carried on before the trigger event
