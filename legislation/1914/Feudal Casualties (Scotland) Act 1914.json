annum, produce on the next recurrence of the fixed interval a sum representing thirty-seven and a half times the highest casualty divided by the number of years constituting such interval: e In cases where casualties consist of sums calculated on the footing of an annual sum being paid for each year from the date of the last entry the compensation shall be such sum as will, with the addition of simple interest at the rate of four per cent. per annum, produce, on the arrival of the time at which the next casualty might be expected to become exigible, a sum equal to the aggregate of (a) the

agreement) be fixed as at the date of notice given in terms of section eleven of this Act, and shall bear interest at the rate of four per cent. per annum from such date until paid, or converted into an annual sum in terms of section nine of this Act: Provided that if before any such notice has been given any casualty shall be or become due, and payment thereof be either demanded or tendered,
