matter or offshore transfer 36A 1 This section applies in a case involving a loss of income tax or capital gains tax, where\u2014 a the lost tax involves an offshore matter, or b the lost tax involves an offshore transfer which makes the lost tax significantly harder to identify. 2 An assessment on a person (\u201cthe taxpayer\u201d) may be made at any time not more than 12 years after the end of the year of assessment to which the lost tax relates. This is subject to section 36(1A) above and any other provision of the Taxes Acts allowing a longer period. 3 Lost income tax or capital gains tax  \u201cinvolves an offshore matter\u201d if it is charged on or by reference to\u2014 a income arising from a source in a territory outside the United Kingdom, b assets situated or held in a territory outside the United Kingdom, c income or assets received in a territory outside the United Kingdom, d activities carried on wholly or mainly in a territory outside the United Kingdom, or e anything having effect as if it were income, assets or

the year of assessment after that to which the lost tax relates; references to income or proceeds transferred include references to assets derived from or representing the income or proceeds. 6 Where lost tax involves an offshore transfer, the cases in which the transfer makes the lost tax significantly harder to identify include any case where, because of the transfer\u2014 a HMRC was significantly less likely to become aware of the lost tax, or b HMRC was likely to become aware of the lost tax only at a significantly later time. 7 But an assessment may not be made under subsection (2) if\u2014 a before the time limit that would otherwise apply for making the assessment, HMRC received relevant overseas information on the basis of which HMRC could reasonably have been expected to become aware of the lost tax, and b it was reasonable to expect the assessment to be made before that time limit. 8 In subsection (7)(a)  \u201c relevant overseas information \u201d means information

territory are parties, with or without other parties. 9 An assessment may also not be made under subsection (2) to the extent that liability to the lost tax arises as a result of an adjustment under
