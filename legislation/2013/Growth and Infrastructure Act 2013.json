subsections (7) to (15) below. 7 References to the affordable housing requirement or the planning obligation are to the requirement or obligation as it stood immediately before the application under section 106BA to which the appeal relates. 8 References to the first, the second or a subsequent application in relation to a planning obligation are to an appeal under this section against a determination on the first, the second or a subsequent application in relation to the obligation (whether or not it is the first such appeal). 9 Section 106BA(5)(d) (discharge of affordable housing requirement) does not apply in relation to an appeal under this section. 10 Subsection (11) applies if, on an appeal under this section, the Secretary of State\u2014 a does not uphold the determination under section 106BA to which the appeal relates (if such a determination has been made), and b determines that the planning obligation is to be modified in accordance with section 106BA(5)(a), (b) or (c). 11 The Secretary of State must also determine that the planning obligation is to be modified so that it provides that, if the development has not been completed before the end of the relevant period, the obligation is treated as containing the affordable housing requirement or requirements it contained immediately before the first application under section 106BA in relation to the obligation, subject to the modifications within subsection (12). 12 Those modifications are\u2014 a the modifications necessary to ensure that, if the development has been commenced before the end of the relevant period, the requirement or requirements apply only in relation to the part of the development that is not commenced before the end of that period, and b such other modifications as the Secretary of State considers necessary or expedient to ensure the effectiveness of the requirement or requirements at the end of that period. 13 In subsections (11) and (12)  \u201c relevant period \u201d means the period of three years beginning with the date when the applicant is notified of the determination on the appeal. 14 Section 106BA and this section apply in relation to a planning obligation containing a provision within subsection (11) as if\u2014 a the provision were an affordable housing requirement, and b a person against whom the obligation is enforceable were a person against whom that requirement is enforceable. 15 If subsection (11) applies on an appeal relating to a planning obligation that already contains a provision within that subsection\u2014 a the existing provision within subsection (11) ceases to have effect, but b that subsection applies again to the obligation. 16 The determination of an appeal by the Secretary of State under this section
