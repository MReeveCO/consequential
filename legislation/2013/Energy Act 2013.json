Use of levy payments 32Q 1 Amounts payable in respect of the certificate purchase levy are to be paid to the administrator of the levy. 2 Amounts received by the administrator under subsection (1) must be paid to\u2014 a the purchasing body of GB certificates, or b the purchasing body of NI certificates, in accordance with such provision as may be contained in the order. 3 Amounts paid to a purchasing body under subsection (2) may be used by that body only for the purpose of discharging the certificate purchase obligation. 4 The order may contain further provision about\u2014 a the calculation of amounts received by the administrator that are to be paid to a relevant purchasing body; b the time by which the administrator must make payments of such amounts to a relevant purchasing body; c the manner in which any such payments are to be made; d how amounts are to be dealt with for the purposes of subsection (2) where the administrator and a relevant purchasing body to whom they are to be paid are the same person. 5 Subsections (2) to (4) are subject to subsections (6) to (10). 6 The order may provide for amounts received by the administrator under subsection (1) to be used by the administrator to make payments\u2014 a into the Consolidated Fund in respect of costs (or a proportion of costs) which have been or are expected to be incurred\u2014 i by the Authority, ii by the Secretary of State, or iii by a relevant designated person, in connection with the performance of functions conferred by or under sections 32N to 32Z2; b into the Consolidated Fund of Northern Ireland in respect of costs (or a proportion of costs) which have been or are expected to be incurred\u2014 i by the Northern Ireland authority, or ii by the Northern Ireland department, in connection with the performance of functions conferred by or under sections 32N to 32Z2. 7 For the purposes of subsection (6)(a),  \u201c relevant designated person \u201d means a person who is designated\u2014 a as the purchasing body of GB certificates by virtue of being an eligible person within section 32N(6)(a) (CFD counterparty); b as the purchasing body of NI certificates by virtue of being an eligible person within section 32N(7) (CFD counterparty); c as an administrator of the levy by virtue of being an eligible person within section 32P(9)(a) or (10)(a) (CFD counterparty). 8 The order\u2014 a may exclude amounts of a specified description from being used as mentioned in subsection (6); b may prevent the administrator using amounts to make payments in respect of costs of a specified description. 9 The purchasing body of GB certificates must, if directed to do so by the Secretary of State, pay into the Consolidated Fund any amounts received under subsection (2) that it would (but for the direction) be able to use under subsection (3) for the purpose of discharging the purchase obligation in respect of GB certificates. 10 The purchasing body of NI certificates must, if directed to do so by the Secretary of State, pay into the Consolidated Fund of Northern Ireland any amounts received under subsection (2) that it would (but for the direction) be able to use under subsection (3) for the purpose of discharging the purchase obligation in respect of NI certificates. 11 In this section  \u201c the order \u201d, in relation to the certificate purchase levy, means the certificate purchase order that imposes the levy. Designation of a CFD counterparty as purchasing body or administrator 32R 1 This section applies in relation to the designation of a person who is a CFD counterparty\u2014 a as a relevant purchasing body under section 32N(4)(b) or (5)(b), or b as the administrator of the levy under section 32P(7)(b) or (8)(b). 2 A designation may be made only with the consent of the person designated. 3 A designation does not cease to have effect if the person's designation as a CFD counterparty ceases to have effect by virtue of section 7(6)(a) or (b) of the Energy Act 2013. 4 A designation ceases to have effect if\u2014 a the Secretary of State by order revokes the designation, or b the person withdraws consent to the designation by giving not less than 3 months' notice in writing to the Secretary of State. 5 The Secretary of State may by order make transitional provision in connection with a designation ceasing to have effect. 6 An order under subsection (5) may in particular make provision about how obligations, imposed by virtue of a certificate purchase order on a person whose designation ceases to have effect, are to be discharged in any period before or after the time when the designation ceases to have effect. 7 Subsection (5) is not to be taken as limiting the power to make transitional provision in a certificate purchase order by virtue of section 32Z(1)(b). GB certificates 32S 1 A certificate purchase order may (subject to subsection (3)) provide for the Authority to issue from time to time, in accordance with such criteria (if any) as are specified in the order, a certificate (\u201ca GB certificate\u201d) to\u2014 a the operator of a generating station, or b if the order so provides, a person of any other description specified in the order. 2 A GB certificate is to certify\u2014 a the matters within subsection (4) or (5), or b if the order provides that a certificate may certify the matters within subsection (6), (7), (8) or (9), the matters within that subsection. 3 A GB certificate certifying that an amount of electricity has been generated from renewable sources in any period may not be issued if\u2014 a a renewables obligation order is in force, and b a renewables obligation certificate has been, or could be, issued under the order in respect of the generation in that period of the same electricity. 4 The matters within this subsection are\u2014 a that the generating station, or, in the case of a certificate issued otherwise than to the operator of a generating station, a generating station specified in the certificate, has generated from renewable sources the amount of electricity stated in the certificate, and b that the electricity has been supplied by an electricity supplier to customers in Great Britain. 5 The matters within this subsection are\u2014 a that the generating station, or, in the case of a certificate issued otherwise than to the operator of a generating station, a generating station specified in the certificate, has generated from renewable sources the amount of electricity stated in the certificate, b that the generating station in question is not in Northern Ireland, and c that the electricity has been supplied by a Northern Ireland supplier to customers in Northern Ireland. 6 The matters within this subsection are\u2014 a that two or more generating stations have, between them, generated from renewable sources the amount of electricity stated in the certificate, and b that the electricity has been supplied by an electricity supplier to customers in Great Britain. 7 The matters within this subsection are\u2014 a that two or more generating stations have, between them, generated from renewable sources the amount of electricity stated in the certificate, b that none of them is a generating station in Northern Ireland, and c that the electricity has been supplied by a Northern Ireland supplier to customers in Northern Ireland. 8 The matters within this subsection are\u2014 a that the generating station, or, in the case of a certificate issued otherwise than to the operator of a generating station, a generating station specified in the certificate, has generated from renewable sources the amount of electricity stated in the certificate, and b that the electricity has been used in a permitted way. 9 The matters within this subsection are\u2014 a that two or more generating stations have, between them, generated from renewable sources the amount of electricity stated in the certificate, and b that the electricity has been used in a permitted way. 10 For the purposes of subsections (8) and (9), electricity generated by a generating station, or generating stations, of any description is used in a permitted way if\u2014 a it is used in one of the ways mentioned in subsection (11), and b that way is specified in the order as a permitted way\u2014 i in relation to all generating stations, or ii in relation to generating stations of that description. 11 Those ways are\u2014 a being consumed by the operator of the generating station or generating stations by which it was generated; b being supplied to customers in Great Britain through a private wire network; c being provided to a distribution system or a transmission system in circumstances in which its supply to customers cannot be demonstrated; d being used, as respects part, as mentioned in one of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) and as respects the remainder\u2014 i as mentioned in one of the other paragraphs, or ii as respects part, as mentioned in one of the other paragraphs and, as respects the remainder, as mentioned in the other; e being used, as respects part, as mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) and, as respects the remainder, by being supplied by an electricity supplier to customers in Great Britain or by a Northern Ireland supplier to customers in Northern Ireland, or both. 12 Subsection (11) of section 32B (meaning of supply of electricity through a private wire network) applies for the purposes of subsection (11)(b) as it applies for the purposes of subsection (10)(b) of that section. NI certificates 32T 1 A certificate purchase order may (subject to subsection (3)) provide for the Northern Ireland authority to issue from time to time, in accordance with such criteria (if any) as are specified in the order, a certificate (\u201ca NI certificate\u201d) to\u2014 a the operator of a generating station in Northern Ireland, or b if the order so provides, a person of any other description. 2 A NI certificate is to certify\u2014 a the matters within subsection (4), or b if the order provides that a certificate may certify the matters within subsection (5), (6) or (7), the matters within that subsection. 3 A NI certificate certifying that an amount of electricity has been generated from renewable sources in any period may not be issued if\u2014 a an order under Article 52 of the Energy (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 is in force, and b a Northern Ireland RO certificate has been, or could be, issued under that order in respect of the same electricity. 4 The matters within this subsection are\u2014 a that the generating station, or, in the case of a certificate issued otherwise than to the operator of a generating station, a generating station in Northern Ireland specified in the certificate, has generated from renewable sources the amount of electricity stated in the certificate, and b that it has been supplied by a Northern Ireland supplier to customers in Northern Ireland. 5 The matters within this subsection are\u2014 a that two or more generating stations in Northern Ireland have, between them, generated from renewable sources the amount of electricity stated in the certificate, and b that it has been supplied by a Northern Ireland supplier to customers in Northern Ireland. 6 The matters within this subsection are\u2014 a that the generating station, or, in the case of a certificate issued otherwise than to the operator of a generating station, a generating station in Northern Ireland specified in the certificate, has generated from renewable sources the amount of electricity stated in the certificate, and b that the electricity has been used in a permitted way. 7 The matters within this subsection are\u2014 a that two or more generating stations in Northern Ireland have, between them, generated from renewable sources the amount of electricity stated in the certificate, and b that the electricity has been used in a permitted way. 8 For the purposes of subsections (6) and (7), electricity generated by a generating station, or generating stations, of any description is used in a permitted way if\u2014 a it is used in one of the ways mentioned in subsection (9), and b that way is specified in the order as a permitted way\u2014 i in relation to all generating stations, or ii in relation to generating stations of that description. 9 Those ways are\u2014 a being consumed by the operator of the generating station or generating stations by which it was generated; b being supplied to customers in Northern Ireland through a private wire network; c being provided to a distribution system located in Northern Ireland, or to transmission system located in Northern Ireland, in circumstances in which its supply to customers in Northern Ireland cannot be demonstrated; d being used, as respects part, as mentioned in one of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) and as respects the remainder\u2014 i as mentioned in one of the other paragraphs, or ii as respects part, as mentioned in one of the other paragraphs and, as respects the remainder, as mentioned in the other; e being used, as respects part, as mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) and, as respects the remainder, by being supplied by a Northern Ireland supplier to customers in Northern Ireland. 10 Paragraph (9) of Article 54 of the Energy (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 (meaning of supply of electricity through a private wire network) applies for the purposes of subsection (9)(b) as it applies for the purposes of paragraph (8)(b) of that Article. Sections 32S and 32T: supplemental provision 32U 1 A certificate purchase order may provide\u2014 a that no certificates are to be issued in respect of electricity generated in specified cases or circumstances, or b that certificates are to be issued in respect of a proportion only of the electricity generated in specified cases or circumstances. 2 In particular, provision made by virtue of subsection (1) may specify\u2014 a electricity generated using specified descriptions of renewable sources, b electricity generated by specified descriptions of generating station, or c electricity generated in specified ways. 3 Provision made by virtue of subsection (1)(b) may include\u2014 a provision about how the proportion is to be determined; b provision about what, subject to such exceptions as may be specified, constitutes sufficient evidence of any matter required to be established for the purpose of determining that proportion; c provision authorising the relevant authority, in specified circumstances, to require an operator of a generating station to arrange\u2014 i for samples of any fuel used (or to be used) in the generating station, or of any gas or other substance produced as a result of the use of such fuel, to be taken by a person, and analysed in a manner, approved by the relevant authority, and ii for the results of that analysis to be made available to the relevant authority. 4 In the case of electricity generated by a generating station fuelled or driven\u2014 a partly by renewable sources, and b partly by fossil fuel (other than waste which constitutes a renewable source), only the proportion attributable to the renewable sources is to be regarded as generated from such sources. 5 A certificate purchase order may specify\u2014 a how the proportion referred to in subsection (4) is to be determined, and b the consequences for the issuing of certificates if a generating station of the type mentioned in that subsection uses more than a specified proportion of fossil fuel during a specified period. 6 Those consequences may include the consequences that no certificates are to be issued in respect of any electricity generated by that generating station during that period. 7 A certificate purchase order may provide that ownership of a certificate may be transferred\u2014 a only to persons of a specified description; b only if other specified conditions are met. 8 A certificate purchase order may specify circumstances in which the relevant authority may revoke a certificate before the certificate purchase obligation in respect of the certificate is discharged (whether before or after the certificate is presented for payment). 9 A certificate purchase order must\u2014 a prohibit the issue of GB certificates certifying that electricity has been supplied to customers in Northern Ireland by virtue of section 32S(5) or (7) where the Northern Ireland authority has notified the Authority that it is not satisfied that the electricity in question has been supplied to customers in Northern Ireland, and b require the revocation of such a certificate if the Northern Ireland authority so notifies the Authority at a time between the issue of the certificate and its presentation for payment for the purposes of the certificate purchase obligation. 10 A certificate purchase order may make provision requiring a person to whom a certificate is issued to pay to the relevant authority an amount equal to any amount that has been paid in respect of the certificate under the certificate purchase obligation if it appears to the authority that\u2014 a the certificate should not have been issued to that person, and b it is not possible to secure the recovery of such an amount by refusing to issue another certificate to the person. 11 Provision under subsection (10) may include provision about enforcement and appeals. 12 The Authority must pay any amounts it receives by virtue of subsection (10) into the Consolidated Fund. 13 The Northern Ireland authority must pay any amounts it receives by virtue of subsection (10) into the Consolidated Fund of Northern Ireland. Certificate purchase orders: amounts of electricity stated in certificates 32V 1 A certificate purchase order may specify the amount of electricity to be stated in each certificate, and different amounts may be specified in relation to different cases or circumstances. 2 In particular, different amounts may be specified in relation to\u2014 a electricity generated from different renewable sources; b electricity generated by different descriptions of generating station; c electricity generated in different ways. 3 In this section  \u201c banding provision \u201d means provision made in a certificate purchase order by virtue of subsection (1). 4 Before making any banding provision, the Secretary of State must have regard to the following matters\u2014 a the costs (including capital costs) associated with generating electricity from each of the renewable sources or with transmitting or distributing electricity so generated; b the income of operators of generating stations in respect of electricity generated from each of those sources or associated with the generation of such electricity; c the effect of paragraph 19 of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 2000 (supplies of electricity from renewable sources exempted from the climate change levy) in relation to electricity generated from each of those sources; d the desirability of securing the long term growth, and economic viability, of the industries associated with the generation of electricity from renewable sources; e the likely effect of the proposed banding provision on the number of certificate issued by the relevant authority, and the impact this will have on consumers; f the potential contribution of electricity generated from each renewable source to the attainment of any target which relates to the generation of electricity or the production of energy and is imposed by, or results from or arises out of, an  EU  obligation. 5 For the purposes of subsection (4)(a), the costs associated with generating electricity from a renewable source include any costs associated with the production or supply of heat produced in connection with that generation. 6 For the purposes of subsection (4)(b), an operator's income associated with the generation of electricity from a renewable source includes any income connected with\u2014 a the acquisition of the renewable source; b the supply of heat produced in connection with the generation; c the disposal of any by-product of the generation process. 7 After the first order containing banding provision is made by the Secretary of State, no subsequent order containing such provision may be made by the Secretary of State except following a review held by virtue of subsection (8). 8 A certificate purchase order may authorise the Secretary of State to review the whole or any part of the banding provision at any time when the Secretary of State is satisfied that one or more of the specified conditions is satisfied. Section 32V: transitional provision and savings 32W 1 This section applies where a certificate purchase order contains banding provision. 2 The order may provide for the effect of any banding provision made in an earlier such order to continue, in such circumstances as may be specified, in relation to\u2014 a the electricity generated by generating stations of such descriptions as may be specified, or b so much of the electricity as may be determined in accordance with the order. 3 The order may provide for\u2014 a the effect of any banding provision made in a renewables obligation order by virtue of section 32D(1) to apply, in such circumstances as may be specified, in relation to GB certificates as it applied in relation to renewables obligation certificates; b the effect of any banding provision made in an order under Article 52 of the Energy (Northern Ireland) Order 2003, by virtue of Article 54B(1) of the Order, to apply, in such circumstances as may be specified, in relation to NI certificates as it applied in relation to Northern Ireland RO certificates. 4 Section 32V(4) and (7) do not apply in relation to provision of the kind mentioned in subsection (2) or (3) above. 5 Subsection (7) applies to a generating station in respect of which a statutory grant has been awarded if\u2014 a the generating station is of a specified description, or b the circumstances of the case meet specified requirements. 6 The requirements specified under subsection (5)(b) may relate to the time when the grant was awarded (whether a time before or after the coming into force of this section). 7 A certificate purchase order which contains banding provision may provide for the operation of that provision in relation to electricity generated by a generating station to which this subsection applies to be conditional upon the operator of the station agreeing\u2014 a if the grant or any part of it has been paid, to repay to the person who made the grant (\u201cthe payer\u201d) the whole or a specified part of the grant or part before the repayment date, b to pay to the payer interest on an amount repayable under paragraph (a) for such period, and at such rate, as may be determined in accordance with the order (which may confer the function of making the determination on a person), and c if the grant or any part of it has not yet been paid, to consent to the cancellation of the award of the grant or part. 8 For the purposes of subsection (7)\u2014 a \u201c the repayment date \u201d means the date specified in or determined in accordance with the order, and b the period for which interest is payable must not begin before the grant was paid or, if the repayment relates to an instalment of the grant, before the instalment was paid. 9 In this section  \u201c statutory grant \u201d means\u2014 a a grant awarded under section 5(1) of the Science and Technology Act 1965 (grants to carry on or support scientific research), or b any other grant which is payable out of public funds and awarded under or by virtue of an Act or other statutory provision (as defined by section 1(f) of the Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland) 1954). 10 This section is without prejudice to section 32Z(1)(b).
