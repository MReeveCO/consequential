references to a proposed transaction are to any assignment, underletting, charging or parting with possession to which the covenant relates, and b references to the person who may consent to such a transaction are to the person who under the covenant may consent to the tenant entering into the proposed transaction. 3 Where there is served on the person who may consent to a proposed transaction a written application by the tenant for consent to the transaction, he owes a duty to the tenant within a reasonable time\u2014 a to give consent, except in a case where it is reasonable not to give consent, b to serve on the tenant written notice of his decision whether or not to give consent specifying in addition\u2014 i if the consent is given subject to conditions, the conditions, ii if the

that he did, b if he gave consent subject to any condition and the question arises whether the condition was a reasonable condition, to show that it was, c if he did not give consent and the question
