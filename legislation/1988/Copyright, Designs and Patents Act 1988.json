made in the manner specified in section 134 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (c. 46), or b where a person is convicted of a relevant offence, in addition to any other penalty which the court may impose. 3 On an application under subsection (2)(a), the court shall make an order for the forfeiture of any unauthorised decoders only if it is satisfied that a relevant offence has been committed in relation to the unauthorised decoders. 4 The court may infer for the purposes of this section that such an offence has been committed in relation to any unauthorised decoders if it is satisfied that such an offence has been committed in relation to unauthorised decoders which are representative of the unauthorised decoders in question (whether by reason of being of the same design

otherwise to have an interest in, the unauthorised decoders to which the application relates a copy of the application, together with a notice giving him the opportunity to appear at the hearing of the application to show cause why the unauthorised decoders should not be forfeited. 6 Service under subsection (5) shall be carried out, and such service may be proved, in the manner specified for citation of an accused in summary proceedings under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (c. 46). 7 Any person upon whom notice is served under subsection (5) and any other person claiming to be the owner of, or otherwise to have an interest in, unauthorised decoders to which an application under this section relates shall be entitled to appear at the hearing of the application to show cause why the unauthorised decoders should not be forfeited. 8 The court shall not make an order following an application under subsection (2)(a)\u2014 a if any person on whom notice is served under subsection (5) does not appear, unless service of the notice on that person is proved, or b if no notice under subsection (5) has been served, unless the court is satisfied that in the circumstances it was reasonable not to serve such notice. 9 Where an order for the forfeiture of any unauthorised decoders is made following an application under subsection (2)(a), any person who appeared, or was entitled to appear, to show cause why the unauthorised decoders should not be forfeited may, within 21 days of the making of the order, appeal to the High Court by Bill of Suspension. 10 Section 182(5)(a) to (e) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 shall apply to an appeal under subsection (9) as it applies to a stated case under Part 2 of that Act. 11 An order following an application under subsection (2)(a) shall not take effect\u2014 a until the end of the period of 21 days beginning with the day after the day on which the order is made, or b if an appeal is made under subsection (9) above within that period, until the appeal is determined or abandoned. 12 An order under subsection (2)(b) shall not take effect\u2014 a until the end of the period within which an appeal against the order could be brought under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (c. 46), or b if an appeal is made within that period, until the appeal is determined or abandoned. 13
