is dead, to his personal representatives, unless the non-disclosure of the unknown fact was wholly or partly attributable to the person convicted. 1ZA For the purposes of subsection (1), there has been a miscarriage of justice in relation to a person convicted of a criminal offence in England and Wales or, in a case where subsection (6H) applies, Northern Ireland, if and only if the new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that the person did not commit the offence (and references in the rest of this Part to a miscarriage of justice are to be construed accordingly). 2 No payment of compensation under this section shall be made unless an application for such compensation has been made to the Secretary of State before the end of the period of 2 years beginning with the date on which the conviction of the person concerned is reversed or he is pardoned. 2A But the Secretary of State may direct that an application for compensation made after the end of that period is to be treated as if it had been made within that period if the Secretary of State considers that there are exceptional circumstances which justify doing so. 3 The question whether there is a right to compensation under this section shall be determined by the Secretary of State. 4 If the Secretary of State determines that there is a right to such compensation, the amount of the compensation

the end of the period mentioned in subsection (2) or, if it is made after the end of that period, the Department of Justice gives a direction under subsection (2A), and d the Department of Justice has reason to believe that protected information may be relevant to the application (for example, because the court which quashed P\u2019s conviction did not make public (in whole or in part) its reasons for quashing P\u2019s conviction). 6D The Department of Justice must refer the application to the Secretary of State who must then take a view as to whether or not any protected information is relevant to the application. 6E If the Secretary of State takes the view that no protected information is relevant to the application, the Secretary of State must refer the application back to the Department of Justice to be dealt with by the Department accordingly. 6F If the Secretary of State takes the view that protected information is relevant to the application, the Secretary of State must refer the application back to the Department of Justice to be dealt with by the Department accordingly unless the Secretary of State is also of the view that, on the grounds of national security, it is not feasible for the Department (including any assessor appointed by the Department) to be provided with either\u2014 a the protected information, or b a summary of the protected information that is sufficiently detailed to enable the Department (including any assessor) to deal properly with the application. 6G If the Secretary of State refers the application back to the Department of Justice under subsection (6F), the Secretary of State must provide the Department with either\u2014 a the protected information, or b a summary of the protected information that appears to the Secretary of

punishment suffered as a result of the conviction, and b the conduct of the investigation and prosecution of the offence. 3 The assessor may make from the total amount of compensation that the assessor would otherwise have assessed as payable under section 133 any deduction or deductions that the assessor considers appropriate by reason of either or both of the following\u2014 a any conduct of the person appearing to the assessor to have directly or indirectly caused, or contributed to, the conviction concerned; and b any other convictions of the person and any punishment suffered as a result of them. 4 If, having had regard to any matters falling within subsection (3)(a) or (b), the assessor considers that there are exceptional circumstances which justify doing so, the assessor may determine that the amount of compensation payable under section 133 is to be a nominal amount only. 5 The total amount of compensation payable to or in respect of a person under section 133 for a
