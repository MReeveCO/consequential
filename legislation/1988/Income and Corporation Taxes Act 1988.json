where members of a qualifying contemplative religious community transfer all their income and assets, or covenant all their income, to the community (\u201cthe independent community\u201d)\t\t\t\t\t(and for this purpose it is irrelevant whether or not the community is part of an order or religious institution). 2 As respects each chargeable period of the independent community, and each person who is a qualifying member of the independent community at any time in that period, the independent community shall be treated for the purposes of corporation tax as if an amount of its profits for the chargeable period equal to the relevant amount (see subsections (5) to (7)) were income of the qualifying member. 3 Subsection (4) applies in a case where\u2014 a one or more qualifying contemplative religious communities (\u201cconstituent communities\u201d) are part of an order or religious institution (\u201cthe parent body\u201d), and b members of the constituent communities transfer all their income and assets, or covenant all their income, to the parent body. 4 As respects each chargeable period of the parent body, and each person who is a qualifying member of a constituent community at any time in that period, the parent body shall be treated for the purposes of corporation tax as if an amount of its profits for the chargeable period equal to the relevant amount (see subsections (5) to (7)) were income of the qualifying member. 5 For the purposes of subsections (2) and (4), the relevant amount, in relation to a chargeable period, is the amount of the annual personal allowance for persons   born after 5 April 1948 \t\t\t\t\t(see section 35 of ITA 2007) for\u2014 a the tax year which begins in the chargeable period, or b if no tax year begins in the chargeable period, the tax year which is current when the chargeable period begins. 6 But, if the chargeable period is less than 12 months, the relevant amount is\u2014 P 365 \u00d7 A where\u2014 P is the number of days in the chargeable period; A is the amount determined under subsection (5) in relation to the chargeable period. 7 If, during the chargeable period, an individual ceases to be a qualifying member of the independent community or a constituent community (otherwise than on death), the relevant amount, in relation to the chargeable period and that qualifying member, is\u2014 Q P \u00d7 B where\u2014 Q is the number of days in the chargeable period for which the individual is a qualifying member of the independent community or constituent community; P is the number of days in the chargeable period; B is the amount determined under subsection (5), or subsections (5) and (6), in relation to the chargeable period. 8 So far as the exemption from corporation tax conferred by this section calls for repayment of tax, no repayment shall be made except on a claim made by the independent community or parent body. 9 In a case where a member of an

Subsection (4) applies if, as respects a chargeable period\u2014 a section 508A(4) applies in relation to a parent body, b the profits of the parent body in the chargeable period are less than the

State, and any deductible contributions paid in furtherance of the scheme have not been repaid at the expiration of one year from the cancellation, the body of persons carrying out the scheme shall, for the chargeable period in which that year expires, be charged to tax  . . .    upon the aggregate amount of the deductible contributions which have not been repaid at that time. 1A An amount charged to income tax under subsection (1) above is treated for income tax purposes as an amount of income. 1B So far as relating to corporation tax, the charge to tax under subsection (1) has effect as an application of the charge to corporation tax on income. 2 The charge to tax under subsection (1) above shall not be made if the total amount of any contributions, other than deductible contributions, which have been paid under the scheme and have not been repaid before that time is greater than the available resources of the scheme, and shall not in any case be made upon an amount greater than the excess, if any, of those resources over that total amount. 3 In subsection (2) above \u201c the available resources \u201d, in relation to any scheme, means a sum representing the total funds held for the purposes of the scheme at the expiration of one year from the cancellation of the certificate plus a sum representing any funds held for the purposes of the scheme which, during that year, have been applied otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the scheme as in force when the certificate was granted. 4 Where the body of persons carrying out a scheme are charged to tax by virtue of subsection (1) above, and, after the expiration of one year from the cancellation of the certificate, any deductible contribution paid in furtherance of the scheme is repaid, the amount upon which the charge is made shall on the making of a claim be reduced by the amount repaid, and all such repayments of tax shall be made as are necessary to give effect to the provisions of this subsection. 5 In this section \u201c contribution \u201d includes a part of a contribution, and \u201c deductible contribution \u201d means a contribution allowed to be deducted under section 568, any reduction under Part III of Schedule 21 being left out of account. 6 For the purposes of this section, a sum received by any person by way of repayment of contributions shall be deemed to be by way of repayment of the last contribution paid by him, and, if the sum exceeds the amount of that contribution, by way of repayment of the penultimate contribution so paid, and so

modifications, shall be construed as a provision that so much of any provision of the Tax Acts other than that section as authorises the deduction of contributions shall, in relation to the

April 2017, and ii there is no increase on or after 6 April 2017 in the value of any person's rights under the arrangement. 6B For the purposes of subsection (6A)(b)\u2014 a whether there is an increase in the value of a person's rights is to be determined by reference to whether there is an increase in the amount that would, on the valuation assumptions, be available for the provision of benefits under the arrangement to or in respect of the person (and, if there is, the amount of the increase), but b in the case of rights that accrued to a person before 6 April 2017, ignore increases in the value of the rights if in no tax year do they exceed the relevant percentage. 6C For the purposes of subsection (6A)(c)\u2014 a whether there is an increase in the value of a person's rights is to be determined by reference to whether there is an increase in the benefits amount as defined by paragraph 14(7) of Schedule 18 to the Finance Act 2011, but b in the case of rights that accrued to a person before 6 April 2017, ignore increases in the value of the rights if in no tax year do they exceed the relevant percentage. 6D For the purposes of subsection (6A)(d)(ii), regulations made by the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs may make provision\u2014 a for determining whether there is an increase in the value of a person's rights, b for determining the amount of any increase, and c for ignoring the whole or part of any increase; and regulations under this subsection may make provision having effect in relation to times before the regulations are made. 6E In this section,  \u201c relevant percentage \u201d, in relation to a tax year, means\u2014 a where, on 20 March 2017, the rules of the fund include provision for the value of the rights of a person to increase during the tax year at an annual rate specified in those rules, that rate, or b in any other case, the percentage by which the consumer prices index for September in the previous tax year is higher than it was for the September in the tax year before that (or, if greater, 0%). 6F The Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs may by regulations make provision\u2014 a so as to change, or modify the effect of, the benefit accrual condition; b as to the matters to be taken into account in determining whether the benefit accrual condition is met; c for a superannuation fund to be treated to any extent as meeting or not meeting the benefit accrual condition. 6G Provision under subsection (6D) or (6F) may be made by amending this section. 7  For the purposes of this

\u201cmoney purchase benefits\u201d have the meaning given by section 152 of the Finance Act 2004, but for this purpose reading references in that section to a pension scheme as references to a

to a pension scheme as references to a superannuation fund; \u201c pension \u201d includes a gratuity or any sum payable on or in respect of death or, in the case of a pension falling within subsection (2)(g) above, ill-health, and a return of contributions with or without interest thereon or any other addition thereto; \u201c overseas territory \u201d means any territory or country

in it, b he is employed, in circumstances not falling within paragraph (a) above, by a body corporate established for any public purpose in that territory by an enactment of a legislature empowered to make laws for that territory, or c he is the holder of a public office in that territory in circumstances not falling within either paragraph (a) or (b). 10 For the purposes of subsection (9), references to the government of an overseas territory include references to a government constituted for two or more overseas territories, and to any authority established for the purpose of providing or administering services which are common to, or relate to matters of common interest to, two or more such territories. 11 Where the conditions in subsection (6)(a) to (c) are met in the case of a superannuation fund (\u201c the actual fund \u201d)\u2014 a any disqualifying contributions made under an arrangement relating to a member of the actual fund are treated for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts as instead made under an arrangement relating to the member under a separate superannuation fund (\u201cthe shadow fund\u201d for the actual fund), b any disqualifying increase in the value of a person's rights under an arrangement relating to a member of the actual fund is treated for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts as instead being an increase under an arrangement relating to the member under the shadow fund for the actual fund, and c any reference in this or any other Act (including the reference in subsection (3) and any reference enacted after the coming into force of this subsection) to a fund, or superannuation fund, to which subsection (3) applies does not include so much of the actual fund as\u2014 i represents any contribution treated as made under, or any increase in the value of any rights treated as an increase under, the shadow fund of the actual fund or the shadow fund of any other superannuation fund, or ii arises, or (directly or indirectly) derives, from anything within sub-paragraph (i) or this sub-paragraph. 12 For the purposes of subsection (11) a contribution, or an increase in the value of any rights, is  \u201cdisqualifying\u201d if it would (ignoring that subsection) cause the benefit accrual condition not to be met in the case of the actual fund. 13 For the purposes of the provisions of this section relating to the benefit accrual condition, where there is a recognised transfer\u2014 a any transfer of sums or assets to the recipient fund by the recognised transfer is to be categorised as not being  \u201ca contribution\u201d to the recipient fund, and b any increase in the value of rights under the recipient fund that occurs at the time of the recognised transfer is to be treated as not being an increase in that value if the increase is solely a result of the transfer effected by the recognised transfer. 14 For the purposes of subsection (13), where there is a transfer such that sums or assets held for the purposes of, or representing accrued rights under, an arrangement relating to a member of a superannuation fund (\u201c the transferor fund \u201d) are transferred so as to become held for the purposes of, or to represent rights under, an arrangement relating to that person as a member of another superannuation fund, the transfer is a  \u201crecognised transfer\u201d if\u2014 a the conditions in subsection (6)(a) to (c) are met in the case of each of the funds, and b none of the sums and assets transferred\u2014 i represents any contribution treated as made under, or any increase in the value of any rights treated as an increase under, the shadow fund of the transferor fund or the shadow fund of any other superannuation fund, or ii arises, or (directly or indirectly) derives, from anything within sub-paragraph (i) or this sub-paragraph."}, {"act": "Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988", "year": 1988, "section": "616", "section_title": " Other overseas pensions.", "section_text": "616 . . . .

an accounting period became, or would have become, due and payable shall be construed on the basis that corporation tax for an accounting period becomes due and payable on the day following the expiry of nine months from the end of the accounting period. 7E The power conferred by section 59E of the Management Act (alteration of date on which corporation tax becomes due and payable) does not include power to make provision in relation to subsection (7), (7A),  (7AA)   (7B),  (7BB),  (7C) or (7D) above the effect of which would be to change the meaning of references in subsection (7), (7A),  (7AA)

remediation tax credit or life assurance company tax credit or film tax credit or television tax credit or video game tax credit or theatre tax credit or orchestra tax credit or museums and galleries exhibition tax credit or first-year tax credit under Schedule A1 to the Capital Allowances Act    payable to the company (which does not result in a change falling within sub-paragraph (i)), other than a change which in whole or in part corrects an error made by the Board or an officer of the Board, and c as a result only of that change (and, in particular, not as a result of any error in the calculation of the interest), it appears to an officer of the Board that the interest ought not to have been paid, either at all or to any extent, the interest that ought not to have been paid may be recovered from the company as if it were interest charged under Part IX of the Management Act (interest on overdue tax). 8B For the purposes of subsection (8A) above, the cases where there is a change in a company\u2019s assessed liability to corporation tax are those cases where\u2014 a an assessment, or an amendment of an assessment, of the amount of corporation tax payable by the company for the accounting period in question is made, or b a determination of that amount is made under paragraph 36 or 37 of Schedule 18 to the Finance Act 1998 (which until superseded by a self-assessment under that Schedule has effect as if it were one), whether or not any previous assessment or determination has been made. 8BA For the purposes of subsection (8A)(b) above, the cases where there is a change in the amount of the R&D tax credit  . . .  , the land remediation tax credit or the life assurance company tax credit or film tax credit or television tax credit or video game tax credit or theatre tax credit or orchestra tax credit or museums and galleries exhibition tax credit or first-year tax credit under Schedule A1 to the Capital Allowances Act    payable to the company are those cases where an assessment, or an amendment to an assessment, is made to recover an amount of R&D tax credit  . . .  , land remediation tax credit or life assurance company tax credit or film tax credit or television tax credit or video game tax credit or theatre tax credit or orchestra tax credit or museums and galleries exhibition tax credit or first-year tax credit under Schedule A1 to the Capital Allowances Act    paid to the company for the accounting period in question. 8C In subsection (8A)(b) above \u201c error \u201d includes\u2014 a any computational error; and b the allowance of a claim or election which ought not to have been allowed. 9 In this section \u201c the appointed day \u201d means such day or days, not being earlier than 31st March 1992, as the Treasury may by order appoint
