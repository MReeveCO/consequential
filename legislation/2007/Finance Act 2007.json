person (P) acquires either it or a chargeable interest deriving from it, b a number of transactions (including the disposal and acquisition) are involved in connection with the disposal and acquisition (\u201cthe scheme transactions\u201d), and c the sum of the amounts of stamp duty land tax payable in respect of the scheme transactions is less than the amount that would be payable on a notional land transaction effecting the acquisition of V's chargeable interest by P on its disposal by  V. 2 In subsection (1)  \u201c transaction \u201d includes, in particular\u2014 a a non-land transaction, b an agreement, offer or undertaking not to take specified action, c any kind of arrangement whether or not it could otherwise be described as a transaction, and d a transaction which takes place after the acquisition by P of the chargeable interest. 3 The scheme transactions may include, for example\u2014 a the acquisition by P of a lease deriving from a freehold owned or formerly owned by V; b a sub-sale to a third person; c the grant of a lease to a third person subject to a right to terminate; d the exercise of a right to terminate a lease or to take some other action; e an agreement not to exercise a right to terminate a lease or to take some other action; f the variation of a right to terminate a lease or to take some other action. 4 Where this section applies\u2014 a any of the scheme transactions which is a land transaction shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Part, but b there shall be a notional land transaction for the purposes of this Part effecting the acquisition of V's chargeable interest by P on its disposal by V. 5 The chargeable consideration on the notional transaction mentioned in subsections (1)(c) and (4)(b) is the largest amount (or aggregate amount)\u2014 a given by or on behalf of any one person by way of consideration for the scheme transactions, or b received by or on behalf of V (or a person connected with V within the meaning of section 839 of the Taxes Act 1988) by way of consideration for the scheme transactions. 6 The effective date of the notional transaction is\u2014 a the last date of completion for the

transactions. 2 The notional transaction under section 75A attracts any relief under this Part which it would attract if it were an actual transaction (subject to the terms and restrictions of the relief). 3 The notional transaction under section 75A is a land transaction entered into for the purposes of or in connection with the transfer of an undertaking or part for the purposes of paragraphs 7 and 8 of Schedule 7, if any of the scheme transactions is entered into for the purposes of or in connection with the transfer of the undertaking or part. 4 In the application of section 75A(5) no

8, applies. 5 In the application of section 75A(5) an amount given or received partly in respect of the chargeable interest acquired by P and partly in respect of another chargeable interest shall be subjected to just and reasonable apportionment. 6 Section 53 applies to the notional transaction under section 75A. 7 Paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 applies to the notional transaction under section 75A. 8

purposes of section 75A a reference to an amount of consideration includes a reference to the value of consideration given as money's worth. 10 Stamp duty land tax paid in respect of a land

be treated as notifiable, or b arrangements are to be treated as notifiable. 2 An application must specify\u2014 a the proposal or arrangements in respect of which the order is sought, and b the promoter. 3 On an application the Special Commissioners may make the order only if satisfied that HMRC\u2014 a have taken all reasonable steps to establish whether the proposal or arrangements are notifiable, and b have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the proposal or arrangements may be notifiable. 4 Reasonable steps under subsection (3)(a) may (but need not) include taking action under section 313A or 313B. 5 Grounds for suspicion under subsection (3)(b) may include\u2014 a the fact that the relevant arrangements fall within a description prescribed under section 306(1)(a); b an attempt by the promoter to avoid or delay providing information or documents about the proposal or arrangements under or by virtue of section 313A or 313B; c the promoter's failure to comply with a requirement under or by virtue of section 313A or 313B in relation to another proposal or other arrangements. 6 Where an order is made under this section in respect of a proposal or arrangements, the

satisfied that HMRC have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the information or documents\u2014 a form part of the prescribed information, or b will support or explain the prescribed information. 4

arrangements to which it relates. 3 For the purpose of subsection (1)(b)\u2014 a it is not sufficient to refer to the fact that a lawyer or other professional has given an opinion, b the reasons must show, by reference to this Part and regulations under it, why P thinks the proposal or arrangements are not notifiable by P, and c in particular, if P asserts that the arrangements do not fall within any description prescribed under section 306(1)(a), the reasons must provide sufficient information to enable HMRC to confirm the assertion. 4 P must comply with a requirement under or by virtue of subsection (1) within\u2014 a the prescribed period, or b such longer period as HMRC may direct. Reasons for non-disclosure: supporting information 313B 1 Where HMRC receive from a person (P) a statement of reasons why a proposal or arrangements are not notifiable by P, HMRC may apply to the Special Commissioners for an order requiring P to provide specified information or documents in support of the reasons. 2 P must comply with a requirement under or by virtue of subsection (1) within\u2014 a the prescribed period, or b such longer period as HMRC may direct. 3 The power under subsection (1)\u2014 a may be exercised more than once, and b applies whether or not the statement of reasons was received under section 313A(1)(b). 6 After section 314 insert\u2014 Order to disclose 314A 1 HMRC may apply to the Special Commissioners for an order that\u2014 a a proposal is notifiable, or b arrangements are notifiable. 2 An application must specify\u2014 a the proposal or arrangements in respect of which the order is sought, and b the promoter. 3 On an application the Special Commissioners may make the order only if satisfied that section 306(1)(a) to (c) applies to the relevant arrangements. 7 After section 317 insert\u2014 Special Commissioners: procedure 317A Sections 56B to 56D of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (procedure) shall apply (with any necessary modifications) to applications under this Part as to appeals. 8 In section 318(1) (interpretation)\u2014 a after the definition of  \u201ccorporation tax\u201d insert\u2014 \u201c HMRC \u201d means the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs;
