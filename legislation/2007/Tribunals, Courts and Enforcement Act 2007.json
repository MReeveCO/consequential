Power to make order 112B 1 The county court  may make an administration order if the conditions in subsections (2) to (7) are met. 2 The order must be made in respect of an individual who is a debtor under two or more qualifying debts. 3 That individual (\u201c the debtor \u201d) must not be a debtor under any business debts. 4 The debtor must not be excluded under any of the following\u2014 a the AO exclusion; b the voluntary arrangement exclusion; c the bankruptcy exclusion. 5 The debtor must be unable to pay one or more of his qualifying debts. 6 The total amount of the debtor's qualifying debts must be less than, or the same as, the prescribed maximum. 7 The debtor's surplus income must be more than the prescribed minimum. 8 Before making an administration order, the county court must have regard to any representations made\u2014 a by any person about why the order should not be made, or b by a creditor under a debt about why the debt should not be taken into account in calculating the total amount of the debtor's qualifying debts. Scheduling debts Scheduling declared debts 112C 1 This section applies to a qualifying debt (\u201cthe declared debt\u201d) if\u2014 a an administration order is made, and b when the order is made, the debt is taken into account in calculating the total amount of the debtor's qualifying debts for the purposes of section 112B(6). 2 If the declared debt is already due at the time the administration order is made, the  ... county court must schedule the debt to the order when the order is made. 3 If the declared debt becomes due after the administration order is made, the  ... county court must schedule the debt to the order if the debtor, or the creditor under the debt, applies to the court for the debt to be scheduled. 4 This section is subject to section 112AG(5). Scheduling new debts 112D 1 This section applies to a qualifying debt (\u201cthe new debt\u201d) if the debt\u2014 a arises after an administration order is made, and b becomes due during the currency of the order. 2 The  ... county court may schedule the new debt to the administration order if these conditions are met\u2014 a the debtor, or the creditor under the new debt, applies to the court for the debt to be scheduled; b the total amount of the debtor's qualifying debts (including the new debt) is less than, or the same as, the prescribed maximum. Requirements imposed by order Repayment requirement 112E 1 An administration order must, during the currency of the order, impose a repayment requirement on the debtor. 2 A repayment requirement is a requirement for the debtor to repay the scheduled debts. 3 The repayment requirement may provide for the debtor to repay a particular scheduled debt in full or to some other extent. 4 The repayment requirement may provide for the debtor to repay different scheduled debts to different extents. 5 In the case of a new debt scheduled to the order in accordance with section 112D, the repayment requirement may provide that no due repayment in respect of the new debt is to be made until the debtor has made all due repayments in respect of declared debts. 6 The repayment requirement must provide that the due repayments are to be made by instalments. 7 It is for the  ... county court to decide when the instalments are to be made. 8 But the  ... county court is to determine the amount of the instalments in accordance with repayment regulations. 9 Repayment regulations are regulations which make provision for instalments to be determined by reference to the debtor's surplus income. 10 The repayment requirement may provide that the due repayments are to be made by other means (including by one or more lump sums) in addition to the instalments required in accordance with subsection (6). 11 The repayment requirement may include provision in addition to any that is required or permitted by this section. 12 In this section\u2014 \u201c declared debt \u201d has the same meaning as in section 112C (and for this purpose it does not matter whether a declared debt is scheduled to the administration order when it is made, or afterwards); \u201c due repayments \u201d means repayments which the repayment requirement requires the debtor to make; \u201c new debt \u201d has the same meaning as in section 112D. Presentation of bankruptcy petition 112F 1 An administration order must, during the currency of the order, impose the following requirement. 2 The requirement is that no qualifying creditor of the debtor is to present a bankruptcy petition against the debtor in respect of a qualifying debt, unless the creditor has the permission of the  ... county court. 3 The  ... county court may give permission for the purposes of subsection (2) subject to such conditions as it thinks fit. Remedies other than bankruptcy 112G 1 An administration order must, during the currency of the order, impose the following requirement. 2 The requirement is that no qualifying creditor of the debtor is to pursue any remedy for the recovery of a qualifying debt unless\u2014 a regulations under subsection (3) provide otherwise, or b the creditor has the permission of the  ... county court. 3 Regulations may specify classes of debt which are exempted (or exempted for specified purposes) from the restriction imposed by subsection (2). 4 The  ... county court may give permission for the purposes of subsection (2)(b) subject to such conditions as it thinks fit. 5 This section does not have any effect in relation to bankruptcy proceedings. Charging of interest etc 112H 1 An administration order must, during the currency of the order, impose the following requirement. 2 The requirement is that no creditor under a scheduled debt is to charge any sum by way of interest, fee or other charge in respect of that debt. Stopping supplies of gas or electricity 112I 1 An administration order must, during the currency of the order, impose the requirement in subsection (3). 2 In relation to that requirement, a domestic utility creditor is any person who\u2014 a provides the debtor with a supply of mains gas or mains electricity for the debtor's own domestic purposes, and b is a creditor under a qualifying debt that relates to the provision of that supply. 3 The requirement is that no domestic utility creditor is to stop the supply of gas or electricity, or the supply of any associated services, except in the cases in subsections (4) to (6). 4 The first case is where the reason for stopping a supply relates to the non-payment by the debtor of charges incurred in connection with that supply after the making of the administration order. 5 The second case is where the reason for stopping a supply is unconnected with the non-payment by the debtor of any charges incurred in connection with\u2014 a that supply, or b any other supply of mains gas or mains electricity, or of associated services, that is provided by the domestic utility creditor. 6 The third case is where the  ... county court gives permission to stop a supply. 7 The  ... county court may give permission for the purposes of subsection (6) subject to such conditions as it thinks fit. 8 A supply of mains gas is a supply of the kind mentioned in section 5(1)(b) of the Gas Act 1986. 9 A supply of mains electricity is a supply of the kind mentioned in section 4(1)(c) of the Electricity Act 1989.

Duration 112K 1 The county court  may, at the time it makes an administration order, specify a day on which the order will cease to have effect. 2 The court may not specify a day which falls after the last day of the maximum permitted period. 3 If the court specifies a day under this section, the order ceases to have effect on that day. 4 If the court does not specify a day under this section, the order ceases to have effect at the end of the maximum permitted period. 5 The maximum permitted period is the period of five years beginning with the day on which the order is made. 6 This section is subject to\u2014 a section 112S (variation of duration); b section 112W (effect of revocation). 7 This section is also subject to the following (effect of enforcement restriction order or debt relief order on administration order)\u2014 a section 117I of this Act; b section 251F of the Insolvency Act 1986. Effects of order Effect on other debt management arrangements 112L 1 This section applies if\u2014 a an administration order is made, and b immediately before the order is made, other debt management arrangements are in force in respect of the debtor. 2 The other debt management arrangements cease to be in force when the administration order is made. 3 If the  ... county court is aware of the other debt management arrangements, the court must give the relevant authority notice that the order has been made. 4 In a case where the  ... county court is aware of other debt management arrangements at the time it makes the order, it must give the notice as soon as practicable after making the order. 5 In a case where the  ... county court becomes aware of those arrangements after it makes the order, it must give the notice as soon as practicable after becoming aware of them. 6 \u201c Other debt management arrangements \u201d means any of the following\u2014 a an enforcement restriction order under Part 6A of this Act; b a debt relief order under Part 7A of the Insolvency Act 1986; c a debt repayment plan arranged in accordance with a debt management scheme that is approved under Chapter 4 of Part 5 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. 7 \u201c The relevant authority \u201d means\u2014 a in relation to an enforcement restriction order: the  ... county court  ...; b in relation to a debt relief order: the official receiver; c in relation to a debt repayment plan: the operator of the debt management scheme in accordance with which the plan is arranged. 8 For the purposes of this section a debt relief order is  \u201cin force\u201d if the moratorium applicable to the order under section 251H of the Insolvency Act 1986 has not yet ended. Duty to provide information 112M 1 This section applies if, and for as long as, an administration order has effect in respect of a debtor. 2 The debtor must, at the prescribed times, provide the  ... county court with particulars of his\u2014 a earnings, b income, c assets, and d outgoings. 3 The debtor must provide particulars of those matters\u2014 a as the matters are at the time the particulars are provided, and b as the debtor expects the matters to be at such times in the future as are prescribed. 4 If the debtor intends to dispose of any of his property he must, within the prescribed period, provide the  ... county court with particulars of the following matters\u2014 a the property he intends to dispose of; b the consideration (if any) he expects will be given for the disposal; c such other matters as may be prescribed; d such other matters as the court may specify. 5 But subsection (4) does not apply if the disposal is of\u2014 a goods that are exempt goods for the purposes of Schedule 12 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, b goods that are protected under any other enactment from being taken control of under that Schedule, or c prescribed property. 6 The duty under subsection (4) to provide the  ... county court with particulars of a proposed disposal of property applies whether the debtor is the sole owner, or one of several owners, of the property. 7 In any provision of this section  \u201c prescribed \u201d means prescribed in regulations for the purposes of that provision. Offence if information not provided 112N 1 A person commits an offence if he fails to comply with\u2014 a section 112M(2) and (3), or b section 112M(4). 2 A person who commits an offence under subsection (1) may be ordered by a judge of the  ... county court to pay a fine of not more than \u00a3250 or to be imprisoned for not more than 14 days. 3 Where under subsection (2) a person is ordered to be imprisoned by a judge of the  ... county court,  a judge of the county court  may at any time\u2014 a revoke the order, and b if the person is already in custody, order his discharge. 4 Section 129 of this Act (enforcement of fines) applies to payment of a fine imposed under subsection (2). 5 For the purposes of section 13 of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 (appeal in cases of contempt of court), subsection (2) is to be treated as an enactment enabling a county court to deal with an offence under subsection (1) as if it were a contempt of court. 6 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Appropriation of money paid 112P 1 Money paid into court under an administration order is to be appropriated\u2014 a first in satisfaction of any relevant court fees, and b then in liquidation of debts. 2 Relevant court fees are any fees under an order made under section 92 of the Courts Act 2003 which are payable by the debtor in respect of the administration order. Discharge from debts 112Q 1 If the debtor repays a scheduled debt to the extent provided for by the administration order, the  ... county court must\u2014 a order that the debtor is discharged from the debt, and b de-schedule the debt. 2 If the debtor repays all of the scheduled debts to the extent provided for by the administration order, the  ... county court must revoke the order. 3 Subsections (1) and (2) apply to all scheduled debts, including any which, under the administration order, are to be repaid other than to their full extent.
