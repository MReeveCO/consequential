Effect of community treatment order 17D 1 The application for admission for treatment in respect of a patient shall not cease to have effect by virtue of his becoming a community patient. 2 But while he remains a community patient\u2014 a the authority of the managers to detain him under section 6(2) above in pursuance of that application shall be suspended; and b reference (however expressed) in this or any other Act, or in any subordinate legislation (within the meaning of the Interpretation Act 1978), to patients liable to be detained, or detained, under this Act shall not include him. 3 And section 20 below shall not apply to him while he remains a community patient. 4 Accordingly, authority for his detention shall not expire during any period in which that authority is suspended by virtue of subsection (2)(a) above. Power to recall to hospital 17E 1 The responsible clinician may recall a community patient to hospital if in his opinion\u2014 a the patient requires medical treatment in hospital for his mental disorder; and b there would be a risk of harm to the health or safety of the patient or to other persons if the patient were not recalled to hospital for that purpose. 2 The responsible clinician may also recall a community patient to hospital if the patient fails to comply with a condition specified under section 17B(3) above. 3 The hospital to which a patient is recalled need not be the responsible hospital. 4 Nothing in this section prevents a patient from being recalled to a hospital even though he is already in the hospital at the time when the power of recall is exercised; references to recalling him shall be construed accordingly. 5 The power of recall under subsections (1) and (2) above shall be exercisable by notice in writing to the patient. 6 A notice under this section recalling a patient to hospital shall be sufficient authority for the managers of that hospital to detain the patient there in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Powers in respect of recalled patients 17F 1 This section applies to a community patient who is detained in a hospital by virtue of a notice recalling him there under section 17E above. 2 The patient may be transferred to another hospital in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed in regulations made by the Secretary of State (if the hospital in which the patient is detained is in England) or the Welsh Ministers (if that hospital is in Wales). 3 If he is so transferred to another hospital, he shall be treated for the purposes of this section (and section 17E above) as if the notice under that section were a notice recalling him to that other hospital and as if he had been detained there from the time when his detention in hospital by virtue of the notice first began. 4 The responsible clinician may by order in writing revoke the community treatment order if\u2014 a in his opinion, the conditions mentioned in section 3(2) above are satisfied in respect of the patient; and b an approved mental health professional states in writing\u2014 i that he agrees with that opinion; and ii that it is appropriate to revoke the order. 5 The responsible clinician may at any time release the patient under this section, but not after the community treatment order has been revoked. 6 If the patient has not been released, nor the community treatment order revoked, by the end of the period of 72 hours, he shall then be released. 7 But a patient who is released under this section remains subject to the community treatment order. 8 In this section\u2014 a \u201c the period of 72 hours \u201d means the period of 72 hours beginning with the time when the patient's detention in hospital by virtue of the notice under section 17E above begins; and b references to being released shall be construed as references to being released from that detention (and accordingly from being recalled to hospital). Effect of revoking community treatment order 17G 1 This section applies if a community treatment order is revoked under section 17F above in respect of a patient. 2 Section 6(2) above shall have effect as if the patient had never been discharged from hospital by virtue of the community treatment order. 3 The provisions of this or any other Act relating to patients liable to be detained (or detained) in pursuance of an application for admission for treatment shall apply to the patient as they did before the community treatment order was made, unless otherwise provided. 4 If, when the order is revoked, the patient is being detained in a hospital other than the responsible hospital, the provisions of this Part of this Act shall have effect as if\u2014 a the application for admission for treatment in respect of him were an application for admission to that other hospital; and b he had been admitted to that other hospital at the time when he was originally admitted in pursuance of the application. 5 But, in any case, section 20 below shall have effect as if the patient had been admitted to hospital in pursuance of the application for admission for treatment on the day on which the order is revoked. 3 After section 20 (the cross-heading immediately above which becomes  \u201cDuration of authority and discharge\u201d) insert\u2014 Community treatment period 20A 1 Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, a community treatment order shall cease to be in force on expiry of the period of six months beginning with the day on which it was made. 2 That period is referred to in this Act as  \u201c the community treatment period \u201d. 3 The community treatment period may, unless the order has previously ceased to be in force, be extended\u2014 a from its expiration for a period of six months; b from the expiration of any period of extension under paragraph (a) above for a further period of one year, and so on for periods of one year at a time. 4 Within the period of two months ending on the day on which the order would cease to be in force in default of an extension under this section, it shall be the duty of the responsible clinician\u2014 a to examine the patient; and b if it appears to him that the conditions set out in subsection (6) below are satisfied and if a statement under subsection (8) below is made, to furnish to the managers of the responsible hospital a report to that effect in the prescribed form. 5 Where such a report is furnished in respect of the patient, the managers shall, unless they discharge him under section 23 below, cause him to be informed. 6 The conditions referred to in subsection (4) above are that\u2014 a the patient is suffering from mental disorder of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to receive medical treatment; b it is necessary for his health or safety or for the protection of other persons that he should receive such treatment; c subject to his continuing to be liable to be recalled as mentioned in paragraph (d) below, such treatment can be provided without his being detained in a hospital; d it is necessary that the responsible clinician should continue to be able to exercise the power under section 17E(1) above to recall the patient to hospital; and e appropriate medical treatment is available for him. 7 In determining whether the criterion in subsection (6)(d) above is met, the responsible clinician shall, in particular, consider, having regard to the patient's history of mental disorder and any other relevant factors, what risk there would be of a deterioration of the patient's condition if he were to continue not to be detained in a hospital (as a result, for example, of his refusing or neglecting to receive the medical treatment he requires for his mental disorder). 8 The statement referred to in subsection (4) above is a statement in writing by an approved mental health professional\u2014 a that it appears to him that the conditions set out in subsection (6) above are satisfied; and b that it is appropriate to extend the community treatment period. 9 Before furnishing a report under subsection (4) above the responsible clinician shall consult one or more other persons who have been professionally concerned with the patient's medical treatment. 10 Where a report is duly furnished under subsection (4) above, the community treatment period shall be thereby extended for the period prescribed in that case by subsection (3) above. Effect of expiry of community treatment order 20B 1 A community patient shall be deemed to be discharged absolutely from liability to recall under this Part of this Act, and the application for admission for treatment cease to have effect, on expiry of the community treatment order, if the order has not previously ceased to be in force. 2 For the purposes of subsection (1) above, a community treatment order expires on expiry of the community treatment period as extended under this Part of this Act, but this is subject to sections 21 and 22 below. 4 Schedules 3 and 4 (which contain further amendments) have effect."}, {"act": "Mental Health Act 2007", "year": 2007, "section": "33", "section_title": "Relationship with leave of absence", "section_text": "33 1 The 1983 Act is amended as follows. 2 In section 17 (leave of absence from hospital), after subsection (2) insert\u2014 2A But longer-term leave may not be granted to a patient unless the responsible clinician first considers whether the patient should be dealt with under section 17A instead. 2B For these purposes, longer-term leave is granted to a patient if\u2014 a leave of absence is granted to him under this section either indefinitely or for a specified period of more than seven consecutive days;

Liability for negligence 64I Nothing in section 64D, 64F or 64G above excludes a person's civil liability for loss or damage, or his criminal liability, resulting from his negligence in doing anything authorised to be done by that section. Factors to be considered in determining whether patient objects to treatment 64J 1 In assessing for the purposes of this Part whether he has reason to believe that a patient objects to treatment, a person shall consider all the circumstances so far as they are reasonably ascertainable, including the patient's behaviour, wishes, feelings, views, beliefs and values. 2 But circumstances from the past shall be considered only so far as it is still appropriate to consider them. Interpretation of Part 4A 64K 1 This Part of this Act is to be construed as follows. 2 References to a patient who lacks capacity are to a patient who lacks capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. 3 References to a patient who has capacity are to be read accordingly. 4 References to a donee are to a donee of a lasting power of attorney (within the meaning of section 9 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005) created by the patient, where the donee is acting within the scope of his authority and in accordance with that Act. 5 References to a deputy are to a deputy appointed for the patient by the Court of Protection under section 16 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, where the deputy is acting within the scope of his authority and in accordance with that Act. 6 Reference to the responsible clinician shall be construed as a reference to the responsible clinician within the meaning of Part 2 of this Act. 7 References to a hospital include a registered establishment. 8 Section 64(3) above applies for the purposes of this Part of this Act as it applies for the purposes of Part 4 of this Act. 2 In section 119 of the 1983 Act (practitioners approved for Part 4 and section 118)\u2014 a in subsection (2)\u2014 i after  \u201cthose provisions\u201d insert  \u201c                            or under Part 4A of this Act                          \u201d , ii in paragraph (a), for  \u201cin a registered establishment\u201d substitute  \u201c                            in a hospital or registered establishment or any community patient in a hospital or establishment of any description or (if access is granted) other place                          \u201d , and iii in paragraph (b), for  \u201cin that home\u201d substitute  \u201c                            there                          \u201d , and b after subsection (2) insert\u2014 3 In this section,  \u201c establishment of any description \u201d shall be construed in accordance with section 4(8) of the Care Standards Act 2000. 3 In section 121 of the 1983 Act (Mental Health Act Commission), in subsection (2)(b) after  \u201c61\u201d insert  \u201c                    , 64H(5)                  \u201d . 4 The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (c. 9) is amended as follows. 5 In section 28 (Mental Health Act matters), after subsection (1A)\t\t\t\t\t(inserted by section 28 of this Act) insert\u2014 1B Section 5 does not apply to an act to which section 64B of the Mental Health Act applies (treatment of community patients not recalled to hospital). 6 In section 37 (independent mental capacity advocates: provision of serious medical treatment by  NHS  body), in subsection (2) after  \u201cPart 4\u201d insert  \u201c                    or 4A                  \u201d ."}, {"act": "Mental Health Act 2007", "year": 2007, "section": "36", "section_title": "Repeal of provisions for after-care under supervision", "section_text": "36 1 The 1983 Act is amended as follows. 2 Sections 25A to 25J (after-care under supervision) are omitted. 3 In section 66 (applications to tribunals), in subsection (2)(c), for  \u201ccases mentioned in paragraphs (c) and (ga)\u201d substitute  \u201c                    case mentioned in paragraph (c)                  \u201d . 4 In Part 1 of Schedule 1 (application of certain provisions to patients subject to hospital and guardianship orders: patients not subject to special restrictions), in paragraph 1, for  \u201c25C\u201d substitute  \u201c                    26                  \u201d ."}, {"act": "Mental Health Act 2007", "year": 2007, "section": "37", "section_title": "References", "section_text": "37 1 The 1983 Act is amended as follows. 2 In section 21 (special provision as to patients absent without leave), after subsection (2) insert\u2014 3 Where a patient is absent without leave on the day on which (apart from this section) the managers would be required under section 68 below to refer the patient's case to a Mental Health Review Tribunal, that requirement shall not apply unless and until\u2014 a the patient is taken into custody under section 18 above and returned to the hospital where he ought to be;
