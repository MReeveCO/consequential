defendant (and of any person committed for trial with the defendant) is to be conducted without a jury if\u2014 a he suspects that any of the following conditions is met, and b he is satisfied that in view of this there is a risk that the administration of justice might be impaired if the trial were to be conducted with a jury. 3 Condition 1 is that the defendant is, or is an associate (see subsection (9)) of, a person who\u2014 a is a member of a proscribed organisation (see subsection (10)), or b has at any time been a member of an organisation that was, at that time, a proscribed organisation. 4 Condition 2 is that\u2014 a the offence or any of the offences was committed on behalf of a proscribed organisation, or b a proscribed organisation was otherwise involved with, or assisted in, the carrying out of the offence or any of the offences. 5 Condition 3 is that an attempt has been made to prejudice the investigation or prosecution of the offence or any of the offences and\u2014 a the attempt was made on behalf of a proscribed organisation, or b a proscribed organisation was otherwise involved with, or assisted in, the attempt. 6 Condition 4 is that the offence or any of the offences was committed to any extent (whether directly or indirectly) as a result of, in connection with or in response to religious or political hostility of one person or group of persons towards another person or group of persons. 6A The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland may not issue a certificate under subsection (2) if\u2014 a the proceedings are taken in

partner or a former civil partner of B, c A and B (whether of different sexes or the same sex) live as partners, or have lived as partners, in an enduring family relationship, d A is a friend of B, or

1 The effect of a certificate issued under section 1 is that the trial on indictment of\u2014 a the person to whom the certificate relates, and b any person committed for trial with that person, is to

trial had been conducted with a jury (including power to determine any question and to make any finding which would be required to be determined or made by a jury). 3 Except where the context otherwise requires, any reference in an enactment (including a provision of Northern Ireland legislation) to a jury, the verdict of a jury or the finding of a jury is to be read, in relation to a trial conducted without a jury under this section, as a reference to the court, the verdict of the court or the finding of the court. 4 No inference may be drawn by the court from the fact that the certificate has been issued in relation to the trial. 5 Without prejudice to subsection (2), where the court conducting a trial under this section\u2014 a is not satisfied that a defendant is guilty of an offence for which he is being tried (\u201cthe offence charged\u201d), but b is satisfied that he is guilty of another offence of which a jury could have found him guilty on a trial for the offence charged, the court may convict him of the other offence. 6 Where a trial is conducted without a jury under this section and the court convicts a defendant (whether or not by virtue of subsection (5)), the court must give a judgment which states the reasons for the conviction at, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the time of the conviction. 7 A person convicted of an

4A\u2014 a to the Assembly; and b to the Executive Committee, and the report must include a recommendation as to whether or not the deputy Ministerial office (see subsection (8)) should be retained. 4 If before the end of the period of three years beginning with the time of devolution (\u201cthe initial period\u201d) the Assembly resolves that the deputy Ministerial office should be abolished at a time specified in the resolution (before the end of the initial period), the Secretary of State shall make an order abolishing the deputy Ministerial office (see subsection (9)) at, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the time specified. 5 If\u2014 a subsection (4) does not apply; and b the Assembly does not resolve, before the end of the initial period, that the deputy Ministerial
