Transferable tax allowance for married couples and civil partners Introduction Tax reduction under Chapter 55A 1 This Chapter contains provisions about the entitlement of a spouse or civil partner to a tax reduction in a case where the other party to the marriage or civil partnership has elected for a reduced personal allowance. 2 A tax reduction under this Chapter is given effect at Step 6 of the calculation in section 23. 3 For the effect of section 809B (claim for remittance basis to apply) applying to an individual for a tax year, see section 809G (no entitlement to tax reduction). Tax reduction Tax reduction: entitlement 55B 1 An individual is entitled to a tax reduction for a tax year of the appropriate percentage of the transferable amount if the conditions in subsection (2) are met. 2 The conditions are that\u2014 a the individual is married to, or in a civil partnership with, a person who makes an election under section 55C for the purposes of this section which is in force for the tax year (\u201cthe individual's spouse or civil partner\u201d), b the individual is not, for the tax year, liable to tax at a rate other than the basic rate, the dividend ordinary rate or the starting rate for savings, c the individual meets the requirements of section 56 (residence) for the tax year, and d neither the individual nor the individual's spouse or civil partner makes a claim for the tax year under section 45 (married couple's allowance: marriages before 5 December 2005) or section 46 (married couple's allowance: marriages and civil partnerships on or after 5 December 2005). 3 \u201cThe appropriate percentage\u201d is the basic rate at which the individual would be charged to income tax for the tax year to which the reduction relates. 4 \u201cThe transferable amount\u201d\u2014 a for the tax year 2015-16, is \u00a31,050, and b for the tax year 2016-17 and subsequent tax years, is 10% of the amount of personal allowance specified in section 35(1) for the tax year to which the reduction relates. 5 If the transferable amount calculated in accordance with subsection (4)(b) would otherwise not be a multiple of \u00a310, it is to be rounded up to the nearest amount which is a multiple of \u00a310. 6 If an individual is entitled to a tax reduction under subsection (1), the personal allowance to which the individual's spouse or civil partner is entitled under section 35 or 37 is reduced for the tax year by the transferable amount. 7 If an individual who is entitled to a tax reduction for a tax year under subsection (1) dies during that tax year, subsection (6) is to be ignored (but this does not affect the individual's entitlement to the tax reduction). Election to reduce personal allowance Election to reduce personal allowance 55C 1 An individual may make an election for the purposes of section 55B if\u2014 a the individual is married to, or in a civil partnership with, the same person\u2014 i for the whole or part of the tax year concerned, and ii when the election is made, b the individual is entitled to a personal allowance under section 35 or 37 for that tax year, c assuming the individual's personal allowance was reduced as set out in section 55B(6), the individual would not for that year be liable to tax at a rate other than the basic rate, the dividend ordinary rate or the starting rate for savings, and d where the individual meets the requirements of section 56 (residence) for the tax year by reason of meeting the condition in subsection (3) of that section, the individual meets the condition in subsection (2) of this section. 2 The condition is that the individual's hypothetical net income for the tax year concerned is less than the amount of the personal allowance to which the individual is entitled for that tax year under section 35 or 37. 3 For the purposes of subsection (2), an individual's  \u201chypothetical net income\u201d is the amount that would be that individual's net income calculated at Step 2 of section 23 if that individual's income tax liability were calculated on the basis that the individual\u2014 a was  UK  resident for the tax year concerned (and the year was not a split year), b was domiciled in the United Kingdom for that tax year, c in that tax year, did not fall to be regarded as resident in a country outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of double taxation arrangements having effect at the time, and d for that tax year, had made a claim for any available relief under section 6 of TIOPA 2010 (as required by subsection (6) of that section). 4 An individual's hypothetical net income for a tax year is, to the extent that it is not sterling, to be calculated by reference to the average exchange rate for the year ending on 31 March in the tax year concerned. Procedure for elections under section 55C 55D 1 An election under section 55C is to be made not more than 4 years after the end of the tax year to which it relates. 2 If the conditions in paragraphs (a) to (d) of section 55C(1) continue to be met, an election continues in force in each subsequent tax year unless\u2014 a subsection (3) applies, b the election is withdrawn, or c it ceases to have effect under subsection (5). 3 Where an election is made after the end of the tax year to which it relates, the election has effect for the tax year to which it relates only (and accordingly does not continue in force for subsequent tax years under subsection (2)). 4 An election may be withdrawn only by a notice given by the individual by whom the election was made. 5 If an individual's spouse or civil partner does not obtain a tax reduction under section 55B in respect of a tax year in which an election is in force the election ceases to have effect for subsequent tax years; but this does not prevent an individual making a further election for the purposes of section 55B(2)(a) (whether or not in relation to the same marriage or civil partnership). 6 The withdrawal of an election under subsection (4) does not, except in the cases dealt with by subsection (7), have effect until the tax year after the one in which the notice is given. 7 The withdrawal of an election under subsection (4) has effect for the tax year in which the notice is given if\u2014 a in a case where the individual concerned met the condition in section 55C(1)(a) by reason of being married, the marriage has come to an end in that tax year, or b in a case where the individual concerned met the condition in section 55C(1)(a) by reason of being in a civil partnership, the civil partnership has come to an end in that tax year. 8 For the purposes of subsection (7)(a), a marriage comes to an end if any of the following is made in respect of it\u2014 a a decree absolute of divorce, a decree of nullity of marriage or a decree of judicial separation, or b in Scotland, a decree of divorce, a declarator of nullity or a decree of separation. 9 For the purposes of subsection (7)(b), a civil partnership comes to an end if any of the following is made in respect of it\u2014 a a dissolution order or nullity order, which has been made final, b a separation order, or c in Scotland, a decree of dissolution, a declarator of nullity or a decree of separation. 10 A notice under subsection (4) must\u2014 a be given to an officer of Revenue and Customs, and b must be in the form specified by the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. 11 Paragraph 3(1)(b) of Schedule 1A to  TMA  1970 (amendment of claims and elections) does not apply to an election under section 55C. Supplementary Limitation on number of tax reductions and elections 55E 1 An individual is not entitled to more than one tax reduction under section 55B for a tax year (regardless of whether the individual is a party to more than one marriage or civil partnership in the tax year). 2 An individual is not entitled to have more than one election for the purposes of section 55B which operates for

2010 (charitable donations relief: payments to charity) is amended in accordance with subsections (2) to (7). 2 In section 189 (relief for charitable donations), in subsection (5), after

200 (company wholly owned by a charity), after subsection (4) insert\u2014 4A In the case of a charity which is a registered club, ordinary share capital of a company is treated as owned by a charity if the charity beneficially owns that share capital. 5 In section 202 (meaning of  \u201ccharity\u201d), before paragraph (b) insert\u2014 aa a registered club, . 6 After that section insert\u2014 \u201cRegistered club\u201d 202A In this Chapter  \u201c registered club \u201d has the meaning given by section 658(6) (clubs registered as community amateur sports clubs). 7 After Chapter 2 insert\u2014 CHAPTER 2A Payments to community amateur sports clubs: anti-abuse Restriction on relief for payments to community amateur sports clubs 202B 1 Subsection (2) applies if\u2014 a one or more qualifying payments are made by a company to a registered club (\u201cthe club\u201d) in an accounting period (\u201c the current period \u201d), b the company is wholly owned, or controlled, by the club or by a number of charities which include the club, for all or part of that period, and c inflated member-related expenditure is incurred by the company in that period. 2 For the purposes of section 189 (relief for qualifying charitable donations), the total amount of those qualifying payments is treated as reduced (but not below nil) by the total amount of that inflated member-related expenditure. 3 Subsection (4) applies if\u2014 a the total amount of that expenditure exceeds the total amount of those payments, and b the company made one or more qualifying payments to the club in an earlier accounting period ending not more than 6 years before the end of the current period. 4 For the purposes of section 189, the total amount of the qualifying payments made in the earlier accounting period is treated as reduced (but not below nil) by the amount of the excess. 5 If subsection (3)(b) applies in relation to more than one earlier accounting period\u2014 a subsection (4) applies to treat amounts paid in later accounting periods as reduced in priority to amounts paid in earlier ones (until the excess is exhausted or all amounts have been reduced to nil), and b in applying subsection (4) in relation to an accounting period, the reference to the excess is to be read as a reference to so much of it as exceeds the total amount of qualifying payments which, under that subsection, have previously been reduced to nil by the excess. 6 For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), a reference to the total amount of qualifying payments made in an earlier accounting period is to the total amount of those payments after\u2014 a any reduction under subsection (2), and b any previous reduction under subsection (4). 7 Such adjustments must be made (whether by way of the making of assessments or otherwise) as may be required in consequence of subsections (4) to (6). 8 Section 200 (company wholly owned by a charity) applies for the purposes of this section. 9 For the purposes of this section, the club controls the company if it has the power to secure\u2014 a by means of the holding of shares or the possession of voting power in relation to the company or any other company, or b as a result of any powers conferred by the articles of association or other document regulating the company or any other company, that the affairs of the company are conducted in accordance with the club's wishes. 10 For the purposes of this section two or more charities (including the club) control the company if, acting together, they have the power to secure, as mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (9), that the affairs of the company are conducted in accordance with the wishes of those charities. 11 In this section\u2014 \u201c charity \u201d has the same meaning as in Chapter 2, \u201c qualifying payment \u201d means a qualifying payment for the purposes of Chapter 2, and \u201c registered club \u201d has the same meaning as in Chapter 2, and any reference to a member of the club includes a reference to a person connected with a member of the club. \u201cInflated member-related expenditure\u201d 202C 1 This section applies for the purposes of section 202B. 2 \u201c Inflated member-related expenditure \u201d means\u2014 a employment expenditure incurred in respect of the employment of a member of the club, by the company, where that employment is otherwise than on an arm's length basis, or b expenditure incurred on a supply of goods and services to the club by\u2014 i a member of the club, or ii a member-controlled body, otherwise than on an arm's length basis. 3 But if the features of an employment or supply which cause it to be otherwise than on an arm's length basis, when taken together, are more advantageous to the company than if the employment or supply had been on an arm's length basis, any expenditure incurred in respect of the employment or on the supply is not inflated member-related expenditure. 4 A company is  \u201cmember-controlled\u201d if a member of the club has (or two or more members acting together have) the power to secure\u2014 a by means of the holding of shares or the possession of voting power in relation to that or any other body corporate, or b as a result of any powers conferred by the articles of association or other document regulating that or any other body corporate, that the affairs of the company are conducted in accordance with the wishes of the member (or, as the case may be, members). 5 A partnership is  \u201cmember-controlled\u201d if a member of the club has (or two or more members acting together have) the right to a share of more than half the assets, or of more than half the income, of the partnership. 6 In this section any reference to a member of the club includes a reference to a person connected with a member of the club. 7 For the purposes of subsection (2)(a), the Treasury may by regulations specify\u2014 a descriptions of expenditure which is to be treated as employment expenditure incurred in respect of the employment of a member of a club; b descriptions of expenditure which is not to be so treated. 8 Section 1171(4) (orders and regulations subject to negative resolution procedure) does not apply to any regulations made under subsection (7) if a draft of the statutory instrument containing them has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, the House of Commons. 8 Chapter 9 of Part 13 of that Act (other special types of company: community amateur sports clubs) is amended in accordance with subsections (9) to

is not a charity, the gift is treated as an amount in respect of which the registered club is chargeable to corporation tax, under the charge to corporation tax on income. 10 In section 664 (exemption for interest and gift aid income)\u2014 a in subsection (1), omit the  \u201cand\u201d after paragraph (a) and after paragraph (b) insert , and                         c its company gift income for

b there is in respect of that item an amount of foreign tax for which, under the arrangements, credit is allowable against United Kingdom tax. 2 Credit for the foreign tax in respect of that item must not exceed\u2014 R \u00d7 ( NTC \u2013 D ) where\u2014 R has the same meaning as in section 42(2), NTC is the amount of the non-trading credit, and D is the amount given by subsection (3). 3 D in the formula in subsection (2) is calculated as follows\u2014 Step 1  Calculate the total amount (\u201cTNTD\u201d) of the non-trading debits which are to be brought into account by the company\u2014 in the same accounting period, and in respect of the same loan relationship, derivative contract or intangible fixed asset, as the non-trading credit. Step 2  Calculate the total (\u201cA\u201d) of the amounts which, as amount D, have already been deducted under subsection (2) from other non-trading credits which are to be brought into account in the same period and in respect of the same relationship, contract or asset. Step 3  Calculate the amount given by\u2014 TNTD \u2013 A Step 4  If the amount calculated at step 3 is greater than or equal to NTC, then D equals NTC. Otherwise, D is the amount calculated at step 3. 4 In this section\u2014 \u201c intangible fixed asset \u201d has the same meaning as in Part 8 of CTA 2009, \u201c non-trading credit \u201d means\u2014 a non-trading credit for the purposes of Part 5 of CTA 2009 (which is about loan relationships but also has application in relation to deemed loan relationships and derivative contracts), or a non-trading credit for the purposes of Part 8 of CTA 2009 (intangible fixed assets), and \u201c non-trading debit \u201d means\u2014 a non-trading debit for the purposes of Part 5 of CTA 2009, or a non-trading debit for the purposes of Part 8 of CTA 2009. 8 The amendments made by subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) have effect in relation to payments made by a tax authority on or after 5 December 2013. 9 The amendments made by subsections (6) and (7) have effect in relation to accounting periods beginning on or after 5 December 2013. 10 For the purposes of subsection (9), an accounting period beginning before, and ending on or after, 5 December 2013 is to be treated as if so much of the period as falls before that date, and so much of the period as falls on or after that date, were separate accounting periods."}, {"act": "Finance Act 2014", "year": 2014, "section": "293", "section_title": "Controlled foreign companies: qualifying loan relationships (1)",
