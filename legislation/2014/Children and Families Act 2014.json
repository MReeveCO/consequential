provides or intends to provide care for another person (but this is qualified by section 17ZB(3)). 4 Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a young carer if the local authority have previously carried out a care-related assessment of the young carer in relation to the same person cared for. 5 But subsection (1) does apply (and so a young carer's needs assessment must be carried out) if it

to provide, or continue to provide, care for the person in question, in the light of the young carer's needs for support, other needs and wishes. 8 A local authority, in carrying out a young carer's needs assessment, must have regard to\u2014 a the extent to which the young carer is participating in or wishes to participate in education, training or recreation, and b the extent to which the young carer works or wishes to work. 9 A local authority, in carrying out a young carer's needs assessment, must involve\u2014 a the young carer, b the young carer's parents, and c any person who the young

b that a notice under paragraph (a)\u2014 i is given by such time as may be prescribed, and ii satisfies prescribed conditions as to form and content. 14 Regulations may provide that, where the conditions in subsection (15) are satisfied in relation to a person who is entitled to statutory shared parental pay under subsection (1) or (3) (\u201cV\u201d), V may vary the number of weeks in respect of which V intends to claim statutory shared parental pay. 15 The conditions are\u2014 a that V has given the person who will be liable to pay statutory shared parental pay to V notice of\u2014 i the extent to which V has exercised an entitlement to statutory shared parental pay in respect of the child, ii the extent to which V intends to claim statutory shared parental pay in respect of the child, iii the extent to which another person has exercised an entitlement to statutory shared parental pay in respect of the child, and iv the extent to which another person intends to claim statutory shared parental pay in respect of the child;

b references to placement for adoption were references to placement under section 22C with such a person. Entitlement: general 171ZW 1 Regulations may\u2014 a provide that the following do not have effect, or have effect subject to prescribed modifications, in such cases as may be prescribed\u2014 i section 171ZU(2)(a) to (o), ii section 171ZU(4)(a) to (p), iii section 171ZU(13)(a) and (b), iv section 171ZU(15)(a) to (c), v section 171ZV(2)(a) to (o), vi section 171ZV(4)(a) to (p), vii section 171ZV(13)(a) and (b), and viii section 171ZV(15)(a) to (c); b impose requirements about evidence of entitlement and procedures to be followed; c specify in what circumstances employment is to be treated as continuous for the purposes of section 171ZU or 171ZV; d provide that a person is to be treated for the purposes of section 171ZU or 171ZV as being employed for a continuous period of at least the prescribed period where\u2014 i the person has been employed by the same employer for at least the prescribed period under two or more separate contracts of service, and ii those contracts were not continuous; e provide for amounts earned by a person under separate contracts of service with the same employer to be aggregated for the purposes of section 171ZU or 171ZV; f provide that\u2014 i the amount of a person's earnings for any period, or ii the amount of the person's earnings to be treated as comprised in any payment made to the person or for the person's benefit, are to be calculated or estimated for the purposes of section 171ZU or 171ZV in such manner and on such basis as may be prescribed and that for that purpose payments of a particular class or description made or falling to be made to or by a person are, to such extent as may be prescribed, to be disregarded or, as the case may be, to be deducted from the amount of the person's earnings. 2 The persons upon whom requirements may be imposed by virtue of subsection (1)(b) include\u2014 a a person who, in connection with another person's claim to be paid statutory shared parental pay, is required to satisfy conditions prescribed under section 171ZU(2)(b) or (4)(c) or 171ZV(2)(b) or (4)(c); b an employer or former employer of such a person. 3 In subsection (1)(d)  \u201c the prescribed period \u201d means the period of the length prescribed by regulations under section 171ZU(2)(c) or (4)(d) or 171ZV(2)(c) or (4)(d), as the case may be. Liability to make payments 171ZX 1 The liability to make payments of statutory shared parental pay under section 171ZU or 171ZV is a liability of any person of whom the person entitled to the payments has been an employee as mentioned in section 171ZU(2)(c) or (4)(d) or 171ZV(2)(c) or (4)(d), as the case may be. 2 Regulations must make provision as to a former employer's liability to pay statutory shared parental pay to a person in any case where the former employee's contract of service with the person has been brought to an end by the former employer solely, or mainly, for the purpose of avoiding liability for statutory shared parental pay. 3 The Secretary of State may, with the concurrence of the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, by regulations specify circumstances in which, notwithstanding this section, liability to make payments of statutory shared parental pay is to be a liability of the Commissioners. Rate and period of pay 171ZY 1 Statutory shared parental pay is payable at such fixed or earnings-related weekly rate as may be prescribed by regulations, which may prescribe different kinds of rate for different cases. 2 Subject to the following provisions of this section, statutory shared parental pay is payable to a person in respect of each week falling within a relevant period, up to the number of weeks determined in the case of that person in accordance with regulations under section 171ZU(5) or 171ZV(5). 3 Except in such cases as may be prescribed, statutory shared parental pay is not payable to a person in respect of a week falling within a relevant period if it is not the person's intention at the beginning of the week to care for the child by reference to whom the person satisfies\u2014 a the condition in section 171ZU(2)(a) or (4)(a), or b the condition in section 171ZV(2)(a) or (4)(a). 4 Except in such cases as may be prescribed, statutory shared parental pay is not payable to a person in respect of a week falling within a relevant period during any part of which week the person works for any employer. 5 The Secretary of State may by regulations specify circumstances in which there is to be no liability to pay statutory shared parental pay in respect of a week falling within a relevant period. 6 Where for any purpose of this Part or of regulations it is necessary to calculate the daily rate of statutory shared parental pay, the amount payable by way of statutory shared parental pay for any day shall be taken as one seventh of the weekly rate. 7 For the purposes of this section a week falls within a relevant period if it falls within a period specified in a notice under\u2014 a section 171ZU(2)(j), (4)(k) or (13)(a), or b section 171ZV(2)(j), (4)(k) or (13)(a), and is not afterwards excluded from such a period by a variation of the period or periods during which the person in question intends to claim statutory shared parental pay. 8 In this section  \u201c week \u201d, in relation to a relevant period, means a period of seven days beginning with the day of the week on which the relevant period starts. Restrictions on contracting out 171ZZ 1 An agreement is void to the extent that it purports\u2014 a to exclude, limit or otherwise modify any provision of this Part, or b to require a person to contribute (whether directly or indirectly) towards any costs incurred by that person's employer or former employer under this Part. 2 For the avoidance of doubt, an agreement between an employer and an employee, authorising deductions from statutory shared parental pay which the employer is liable to pay to the employee in respect of any period, is not void by virtue of subsection (1)(a) if the employer\u2014 a is authorised by that or another agreement to make the same deductions from any contractual remuneration which the employer is liable to pay in respect of the same period, or b would be so authorised if the employer were liable to pay contractual remuneration in respect of that period. Relationship with contractual remuneration 171ZZ1 1 Subject to subsections (2) and (3), any entitlement to statutory shared parental pay is not to affect any right of a person in relation to remuneration under any contract of service (\u201ccontractual remuneration\u201d). 2 Subject to subsection (3)\u2014 a any contractual remuneration paid to a person by an employer of that person in respect of any period is to go towards discharging any liability of that employer to pay statutory shared parental pay to that person in respect of that period; and b any statutory shared parental pay paid by an employer to a person who is an employee of that employer in respect of any period is to go towards discharging any liability of that employer to pay contractual remuneration to that person in respect of that period. 3 Regulations may make provision as to payments which are, and those which are not, to be treated as contractual remuneration for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2). Crown employment 171ZZ2 The provisions of this Part apply in relation to persons employed by or under the Crown as they apply in relation to persons employed otherwise than by or under the Crown. Special classes of person 171ZZ3 1 The Secretary of State may with the concurrence of the Treasury make regulations modifying any provision of this Part in such manner as the Secretary of State thinks proper in its application to any person who is, has been or is to be\u2014 a employed on board any ship, vessel, hovercraft or aircraft; b outside Great Britain at any prescribed time or in any prescribed circumstances; or c in prescribed employment in connection with continental shelf operations, as defined in section 120(2). 2 Regulations under subsection (1) may, in particular, provide\u2014 a for any provision of this Part to apply to any such person, notwithstanding that it would not otherwise apply; b for any such provision not to apply to any such person, notwithstanding that it would otherwise apply; c for excepting any such person from the application of any such provision where the person neither is domiciled nor has a place of residence in any part of Great Britain; d for the taking of evidence, for the purposes of the determination of any question arising under any such provision, in a country or territory outside Great Britain, by a British consular official or such other person as may be determined in accordance with the regulations.
