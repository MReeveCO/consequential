with. 4B No variation of a pension sharing order  or a pension compensation sharing order,  shall be made so as to take effect before the   divorce or nullity of marriage order is made final . 4C The variation of a pension sharing order  or a pension compensation sharing order,  prevents the order taking effect before the end of such period after the making of the variation as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Lord Chancellor. 5 Subject to subsections (7A) to  (7G)  below and without prejudice to any power exercisable by virtue of subsection (2)(d), (dd)  , (e) or (g)  above or otherwise than by virtue of this section,  no property adjustment order  or pension sharing order   or pension compensation sharing order  shall be made on an application for the variation of a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order made (whether in favour of a party to a marriage or in favour of a child of the family) under section 23 above, and no order for the payment of a lump sum shall be made on an application for the variation of a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order in favour of a party to a marriage (whether made under section 23 or under section 27 above). 6 Where the person liable to make payments under a secured periodical payments order has died, an application under this section relating to that order  (and to any order made under section 24A(1) above which requires the proceeds of sale of property to be used for securing those payments) may be made by the person entitled to payments under the periodical payments order.  or by the personal representatives of the deceased person, but no such application shall, except with the permission of the court, be made after the end of the period of six months from the date on which representation in regard to the estate of that person is first taken out.   7 In exercising the powers conferred by this section the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, first consideration being given to the welfare while a minor of any child of the family who has not attained the age of eighteen, and the circumstances of the case shall include any change in any of the matters to which the court was required to have regard when making the order to which the application relates, and\u2014 a in the case of a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order made on or after the   making of a divorce or nullity of marriage order,   the court shall consider whether in all the circumstances and after having regard to any such change it would be appropriate to vary the order so that payments under the order are required to be made or secured only for such further period as will in the opinion of the court be sufficient  (in the light of any proposed exercise by the court, where the marriage has been dissolved, of its powers under subsection (7B) below)  to enable the party in whose favour the order was made to adjust without undue hardship to the termination of those payments; b in a case where the party against whom the order was made has died, the circumstances of the case shall also include the changed circumstances resulting from his or her death. 7A Subsection (7B) below applies where, after the dissolution of a marriage, the court\u2014 a discharges a periodical payments order or secured periodical payments order made in favour of a party to the marriage; or b varies such an order so that payments under the order are required to be made or secured only for such further period as is determined by the court. 7B The court has power, in addition to any power it has apart from this subsection, to make supplemental provision consisting of any of\u2014 a an order for the payment of a lump sum in favour of a party to the marriage; b one or more property adjustment orders in favour of a party to the marriage;   ba one or more pension sharing orders; bb a pension compensation sharing order; c a direction that the party in whose favour the original order discharged or varied was made is not entitled to make any further application for\u2014 i a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order, or ii an extension of the period to which the original order is limited by any variation made by the court. 7C An order for the payment of a lump sum made under subsection (7B) above may\u2014 a provide for the payment of that sum by instalments of such amount as may be specified in the order; and b require the payment of the instalments to be secured to the satisfaction of the court. 7D Section 23(6)  above  applies  where the court makes an order for the payment of a lump sum under subsection (7B) above as  it applies where the court  makes such an order under  section 23  above. 7E If under subsection (7B) above the court makes more than one property adjustment order in favour of the same party to the marriage, each of those orders must fall within a different paragraph of section 21(2) above. 7F Sections 24A and 30 above apply where the court makes a property adjustment order under subsection (7B) above as they apply where it makes such an order under  section 24  above.   7G Subsections (3) to (5) of section 24B above apply in relation to a pension sharing order under subsection (7B) above as they apply in relation to a pension sharing order under that section. 7H Subsections (3) to (10) of section 24E above apply in relation to a pension compensation sharing order under subsection (7B) above as they apply in relation to a pension compensation sharing order under that section. 8 The personal representatives of a deceased person against whom a secured periodical payments order was made shall not be liable for having distributed any part of the estate of the deceased after the expiration of the period of six months referred to in subsection (6) above on the ground that they ought to have taken into account the possibility that the court might permit an application under this section to be made after that period by the person entitled to payments under the order; but this subsection shall not prejudice any power to recover any part of the estate so distributed arising by virtue of the making of an order in pursuance of this section. 9 The following are to be left out of account when considering for the purposes of subsection (6) above when representation was first taken out\u2014 a a grant limited to settled land or to trust property, b any other grant that does not permit any of the estate to be distributed, c a grant limited to real estate or to personal estate, unless a grant limited to the remainder of the estate has previously been made or is made at the same time, d a grant, or its equivalent, made outside the United Kingdom (but see subsection (9A) below). 9A A grant sealed under section 2 of the Colonial Probates Act 1892 counts as a grant made in the United Kingdom for the purposes of subsection (9) above, but is to be taken as dated on the date of sealing.   10 Where the court, in exercise of its powers under this section, decides to vary or discharge a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order, then, subject to section 28(1) and (2) above, the court shall have power to direct that the variation or discharge shall not take effect until the expiration of such period as may be specified in the order. 11 Where\u2014 a a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order in favour of more than one child (\u201cthe order\u201d) is in force; b the order requires payments specified in it to be made to or for the benefit of more than one child without apportioning those payments between them; c a   maintenance calculation \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(\u201c  the calculation \u201d) is made with respect to one or more, but not all, of the children with respect to whom those payments are to be made; and d an application is made, before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the date on which   the calculation  was made, for the variation or discharge of the order, the court may, in exercise of its powers under this section to vary or discharge the order, direct that the variation or discharge shall take effect from the date on which   the calculation  took effect or any later date. 12 Where\u2014 a an order (\u201cthe child order\u201d) of a kind prescribed for the purposes of section 10(1) of the Child Support Act 1991 is affected by a   maintenance calculation ; b on the date on which the child order became so affected there was in force a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order (\u201cthe spousal order\u201d) in favour of a party to a marriage having the care of the child in whose favour the child order was made; and c an application is made, before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the date on which the   maintenance calculation  was made, for the spousal order to be varied or discharged, the court may, in exercise of its powers under this section to vary or discharge the spousal order, direct that the variation or discharge shall take effect from the date on which the child order became so affected or any later date. 13 For the purposes of subsection (12) above, an order is affected if it ceases to have effect or is modified by or under section 10 of the Child Support Act 1991. 14 Subsections (11) and (12) above are without prejudice to any other power of the court to direct that the variation of discharge of an order under this section shall take effect from a date earlier than that on which the order for variation or discharge was made.   15 The power to make regulations under subsection (4C) above shall be exercisable by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament. 16 See also section 52A (interpretation of certain references to divorce orders, nullity of marriage orders and judicial separation orders)."}, {"act":
