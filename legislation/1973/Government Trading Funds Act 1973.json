fund \u201d) and, in particular, to be so managed that the revenue of the fund would consist principally of receipts in respect of goods or services provided in the course of the operations in question, and b that the financing of the operations in question by means of a trading fund would be in the interests of the improved efficiency and effectiveness of the management of those operations, he may by order establish a trading fund for the operations in question as from a day appointed by the order. 2 The power to make an order under this section is exercisable only with Treasury concurrence. 3 Where a Minister of the Crown proposes to make an order in respect of any operations (not being operations then financed by means of a trading fund) and considers that\u2014 a the operations in question consist substantially in the provision of goods or services in the United Kingdom otherwise than to departments of the government, and b an opportunity to make representations to him should be given, he shall take such steps as appear to him to be appropriate to give such an opportunity to such persons as appear to him to be appropriate. 4 An order establishing a trading fund shall designate either\u2014 a the National Loans Fund, or b the responsible Minister, as the source of issues to the fund by way of loan (referred to in this Act as the \u201c authorised lender \u201d). 5 Issues to the fund by way of loan by the responsible Minister shall be made out of money provided by Parliament, and the right to repayment of such issues ranks as an asset of the Consolidated Fund. 6 An order establishing a trading fund for operations carried on by a person appointed in pursuance of any enactment may provide\u2014 a for the fund to be under the

this Act, \u201c Minister of the Crown \u201d means the holder of an office in Her Majesty\u2019s Government in the United Kingdom, and includes the Treasury, \u201c order \u201d except in section 2B(8) of this Act means an order under this section, \u201c originating debt \u201d, in relation to a trading fund, means any amount remaining after any repayment or reduction of the amount which, by virtue of section 2(3) and (4) of this Act, is the originating debt of the fund, and \u201c the responsible Minister \u201d, in relation to any operations of a department of the government, means the Minister of the Crown responsible for that department. 8 References in this Act to the provision of services include\u2014 a the provision of any authority required for carrying on any activity or exercising any right, and b the performance of any other functions in connection with the regulation of any activity or right. 9 References in this Act to a Minister of the Crown include Ministers acting jointly, but an order may not designate more than one Minister as the authorised lender."}, {"act": "Government Trading Funds Act 1973", "year": 1973, "section": "2", "section_title": "Assets
