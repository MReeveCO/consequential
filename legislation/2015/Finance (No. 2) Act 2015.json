Meaning of  \u201cinherited\u201d 8J 1 This section explains for the purposes of sections 8E and 8F whether a person (\u201cB\u201d) inherits, from a person who has died (\u201cD\u201d), property which forms part of D's estate immediately before D's death. 2 B inherits the property if there is a disposition of it (whether effected by will, under the law relating to intestacy or otherwise) to B. 3 Subsection (2) does not apply if\u2014 a the property becomes comprised in a settlement on D's death, or b immediately before D's death, the property was settled property in which D was beneficially entitled to an interest in possession. 4 Where the property becomes comprised in a settlement on D's death, B inherits the property if\u2014 a B becomes beneficially entitled on D's death to an interest in possession in the property, and that interest in possession is an immediate post-death interest or a disabled person's interest, or b the property becomes, on D's death, settled property\u2014 i to which section 71A or 71D applies, and ii held on trusts for the benefit of B. 5 Where, immediately before D's death, the property was settled property in which D was beneficially entitled to an interest in possession, B inherits the property if B becomes beneficially entitled to it on D's death. 6 Where the property forms part of D's estate immediately before D's death as a result of the operation of section 102(3) of the Finance Act 1986 (gifts with reservation) in relation to a disposal of the property made by D by way of gift, B inherits the property if B is the person to whom the disposal was made. Meaning of  \u201cclosely inherited\u201d 8K 1 In relation to the death of a person (\u201cD\u201d), something is  \u201c closely inherited \u201d for the purposes of sections 8E and 8F if it is inherited for those purposes (see section 8J) by\u2014 a a lineal descendant of D, b a person who, at the time of D's death, is the spouse or civil partner of a lineal descendant of D, or c a person who\u2014 i at the time of the death of a lineal descendant of D who died no later than D, was the spouse or civil partner of the lineal descendant, and ii has not, in the period beginning with the lineal descendant's death and ending with D's death, become anyone's spouse or civil partner. 2 The rules in subsections (3) to (8) apply for the interpretation of subsection (1). 3 A person who is at any time a step-child of another person is to be treated, at that and all subsequent times, as if the person was that other person's child. 4 Any rule of law, so far as it requires an adopted person to be treated as not being the child of a natural parent of the person, is to be disregarded (but this is without prejudice to any rule of law requiring an adopted person to be treated as the child of an adopter of the person). 5 A person who is at any time fostered by a foster parent is to be treated, at that and all subsequent times, as if the person was the foster parent's child. 6 Where\u2014 a an individual (\u201cG\u201d) is appointed (or is treated by law as having been appointed) under section 5 of the Children Act 1989, or under corresponding law having effect in Scotland or Northern Ireland or any country or territory outside the United Kingdom, as guardian (however styled) of another person, and b the appointment takes effect at a time when the other person (\u201cC\u201d) is under the age of 18 years, C is to be treated, at all times after the appointment takes effect, as if C was G's child. 7 Where\u2014 a an individual (\u201cSG\u201d) is appointed as a special guardian (however styled) of another person (\u201cC\u201d) by an order of a court\u2014 i that is a special guardianship order as defined by section 14A of the Children Act 1989, or ii that is a corresponding order under legislation having effect in Scotland or Northern Ireland or any country or territory outside the United Kingdom, and b the appointment takes effect at a time when C is under the age of 18 years, C is to be treated, at all times after the appointment takes effect, as if C was SG's child. 8 In particular, where under any of subsections (3) to (7) one person is to be treated at any time as the child of another person, that first person's lineal descendants (even if born before that time) are accordingly to be treated at that time (and all subsequent times) as lineal descendants of that other person. 9 In subsection (4)  \u201c adopted person \u201d means\u2014 a an adopted person within the meaning of Chapter 4 of Part 1 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, or b a person who would be an adopted person within the meaning of that Chapter if, in section 66(1)(e) of that Act and section 38(1)(e) of the Adoption Act 1976, the reference to the law of England and Wales were a reference to the law of any part of the United Kingdom. 10 In subsection (5)  \u201c foster parent \u201d means\u2014 a someone who is approved as a local authority foster parent in accordance with regulations made by virtue of paragraph 12F of Schedule 2 to the Children Act 1989, b a foster parent with whom the person is placed by a voluntary organisation under section 59(1)(a) that Act, c someone who looks after the person in circumstances in which the person is a privately fostered child as defined by section 66 of that Act, or d someone who, under legislation having effect in Scotland or Northern Ireland or any country or territory outside the United Kingdom, is a foster parent (however styled) corresponding to a foster parent within paragraph (a) or (b). Claims for brought-forward allowance 8L 1 A claim for brought-forward allowance for a person (see section 8G) may be made\u2014 a by the person's personal representatives within the permitted period, or b (if no claim is so made) by any other person liable to the tax chargeable on the person's death within such later period as an officer of Revenue and Customs may in the particular case allow. 2 In subsection (1)(a)  \u201c the permitted period \u201d means\u2014 a the period of 2 years from the end of the month in which the person dies or (if it ends later) the period of 3 months beginning with the date on which the personal representatives first act as such, or b such longer period as an officer of Revenue and Customs may in the particular case allow. 3 A claim under subsection (1) made within either of the periods mentioned in subsection (2)(a) may be withdrawn no later than one month after the end of the period concerned. 4 Subsection (5) applies if\u2014 a no claim under this section has been made for brought-forward allowance for a person (\u201cP\u201d), b the amount of the charge to tax under section 4 on the death of another person (\u201cA\u201d) would be different if a claim under subsection (1) had been made for brought-forward allowance for P, and c the amount of the charge to tax under section 4 on the death of P, and the amount of the charge to tax under section 4 on the death of any person who is neither P nor A, would not have been different if a claim under subsection (1) had been made for brought-forward allowance for P. 5 A claim for brought-forward allowance for P may be made\u2014 a by A's personal representatives within the allowed period, or b (if no claim is so made) by any other person liable to the tax chargeable on A's death within such later period as an officer of Revenue and Customs may in the particular case allow. 6 In subsection (5)(a)  \u201c the allowed period \u201d means\u2014 a the period of 2 years from the end of the month in which A dies or (if it ends later) the period of 3 months beginning with the date on which the personal representatives first act as such, or b such longer period as an officer of Revenue and Customs may in the particular case allow. 7 A claim under subsection (5) made within either of the periods mentioned in subsection (6)(a) may be withdrawn no later than one month after the end of the period concerned. Residence nil-rate amount: cases involving conditional exemption 8M 1 This section applies where\u2014 a the estate of a person (\u201cD\u201d) immediately before D's death includes a qualifying residential interest, b D dies on or after 6 April 2017, and c some or all of the transfer of value under section 4 on D's death is a conditionally exempt transfer of property consisting of, or including, some or all of the qualifying residential interest. 2 For the purposes of sections 8E and 8F, but subject to subsection (3), the exempt percentage of the qualifying residential interest is treated as being not closely inherited; and for this purpose  \u201cthe exempt percentage\u201d is given by\u2014 X Q R I \u00d7 100 where\u2014 X is the attributable portion of the value transferred by the conditionally exempt transfer, QRI is the attributable portion of the value transferred by the transfer under section 4, and \u201c the attributable portion \u201d means the portion (which may be the whole) attributable to the qualifying residential interest. 3 For the purposes of calculating tax chargeable under section 32 or 32A by reference to a chargeable event related to the qualifying residential interest where D is the relevant person for the purposes of section 33\u2014 a in subsection (2), X is calculated as if the property forming the subject-matter of the conditionally exempt transfer had not included the property on which the tax is chargeable, b section 33 has effect as if for subsection (1)(b)(ii) there were substituted\u2014 ii if the relevant person is dead, the rate or rates that would have applied to that amount in accordance with section 8D(2) and (3) above and the appropriate provision of section 7 above if\u2014 a that amount had been added to the value transferred on the relevant person's death, and b the unrelieved portion of that amount had formed the highest part of that value. , and c for the purposes of that substituted section 33(1)(b)(ii)  \u201c                                  the unrelieved portion                                \u201d  of the amount on which tax is chargeable is that amount itself less the amount (if any) by which\u2014 i D's residence nil-rate amount for the purposes of the particular calculation under section 33, exceeds ii D's residence nil-rate amount for the purposes of the charge to tax under section 4 on D's death. 4 The following provisions of this section apply if immediately before D's death there is a person (\u201cP\u201d) who is D's spouse or civil partner. 5 For the purposes of calculating tax chargeable under section 32 or 32A by reference to a chargeable event related to the qualifying residential interest which occurs after P's death, the amount that would otherwise be D's residence nil-rate amount for those purposes is reduced by the amount (if any) by which P's residence nil-rate amount, or the residence nil-rate amount of any person who dies after P but before the chargeable event occurs, was increased by reason of an amount being available for carry-forward from D's death. 6 Where tax is chargeable under section 32 or 32A by reference to a chargeable event related to the qualifying residential interest which occurs before P's death, section 8G(3) has effect for the purpose of calculating P's brought-forward allowance as if\u2014 a before the  \u201cand\u201d at the end of paragraph (c) there were inserted\u2014 ca reduce that total (but not below nil) by deducting from it the recapture percentage, , b in paragraph (d), before  \u201ctotal\u201d, in both places, there were inserted  \u201creduced\u201d, and c the reference to the recapture percentage were to the percentage given by\u2014 T A R E E \u00d7 100 where\u2014 REE is the residential enhancement at the time of the chargeable event, and TA  is the amount on which tax is chargeable under section 32 or 32A. 7 If subsection (6) has applied by reason of a previous

Restitution interest CHAPTER 1 Amounts taxed as restitution interest Charge to corporation tax on restitution interest 357YA The charge to corporation tax on income applies to restitution interest arising to a company. Restitution interest chargeable as income 357YB 1 Profits arising to a company which consist of restitution interest are chargeable to tax as income under this Part (regardless of whether the profits are of an income or capital nature). 2 In this Part references to  \u201cprofits\u201d are to be interpreted in accordance with section 2(2) of CTA 2009. Meaning of  \u201crestitution interest\u201d 357YC 1 In this Part  \u201c restitution interest \u201d means profits in relation to which Conditions A to C are met. 2 Condition A is that the profits are interest paid or payable by the Commissioners in respect of a claim by the company for restitution with regard to either of the following matters (or alleged matters)\u2014 a the payment of an amount to the Commissioners under a mistake of law relating to a taxation matter, or b the unlawful collection by the Commissioners of an amount in respect of taxation. 3 Condition B is that\u2014 a a court has made a final determination that the Commissioners are liable to pay the interest, or b the Commissioners and the company, have in final settlement of the claim, entered into an agreement under which the company is entitled to be paid, or is to retain, the interest. 4 Condition C is that the interest determined to be due, or agreed upon, as mentioned in subsection (3) is not limited to simple interest at a statutory rate (see section 357YU). 5 Subsection (4) does not prevent so much of an amount of interest determined to be due, or agreed upon, as represents or is calculated by reference to simple interest at a statutory rate from falling within the definition of  \u201crestitution interest\u201d. 6 For the purposes of subsection (2) it does not matter whether the interest is paid or payable\u2014 a pursuant to a judgment or order of a court, b as an interim payment in court proceedings, c under an agreement to settle a claim, or d in any other circumstances. 7 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a \u201c interest \u201d includes an amount equivalent to interest, and b an amount paid or payable by the Commissioners as mentioned in subsection (2) is  \u201cequivalent to interest\u201d so far as it is an amount determined by reference to the time value of money. 8 For the purposes of this section a determination made by a court is  \u201cfinal\u201d if the determination cannot be varied on appeal (whether because of the absence of any right of appeal, the expiry of a time limit for making an appeal without an appeal having been brought, the refusal of permission to appeal, the abandonment of an appeal or otherwise). 9 Any power to grant permission to appeal out of time is to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection (8). Further provision about amounts included, or not included, in  \u201crestitution interest\u201d 357YD 1 Interest paid to a company is not restitution interest for the purposes of this Part if\u2014 a Condition B was not met in relation to the interest until after the interest was paid, and b the amount paid was limited to simple interest at a statutory rate 2 Subsection (1) does not prevent so much of a relevant amount of interest determined to be due, agreed upon or otherwise paid as represents or is calculated by reference to simple interest at a statutory rate from falling within the definition of  \u201crestitution interest\u201d. 3 In subsection (2)  \u201c relevant amount of interest \u201d means an amount of interest the whole of which was paid before Condition B was met in relation to it. 4 Section 357YC(7) applies in relation to this section as in relation to section 357YC. Period in which amounts are to be brought into account 357YE 1 The amounts to be brought into account as restitution interest for any period for the purposes of this Part are those that are recognised in determining the company's profit or loss for the period in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. 2 If Condition A in section 357YC is met, in relation to any amount, after the end of the period for which the amount is to be brought into account as restitution interest in accordance with subsection (1), any necessary adjustments are to be made; and any time limits for the making of adjustments are to be disregarded for this purpose. Companies without GAAP-compliant accounts 357YF 1 If a company\u2014 a draws up accounts which are not GAAP-compliant accounts, or b does not draw up accounts at all, this Part applies as if GAAP-compliant accounts had been drawn up. 2 Accordingly, references in this Part to amounts recognised for accounting purposes are references to amounts that would have been recognised if GAAP-compliant accounts had been drawn up for the period of account in question and any relevant earlier period. 3 For this purpose a period of account is relevant to a later period if the accounts for the later period rely to any extent on amounts derived from the earlier period. 4 In this section  \u201c GAAP-compliant accounts \u201d means accounts drawn up in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. Restitution interest: appeals made out of time 357YG 1 This section applies where\u2014 a an amount of interest (\u201cthe interest\u201d) arises to a company as restitution interest for the purposes of this Part, b Condition B in section 357YC is met in relation to the interest as a result of the making by a court of a final determination as mentioned in subsection (3)(a) of that section, c on a late appeal (or a further appeal subsequent to such an appeal) a court reverses that determination, or varies it so as to negative it, and d the determination reversing or varying the determination by virtue of which Condition B was met is itself a final determination. 2 This Part has effect as if the interest had never been restitution interest. 3 If\u2014 a the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs have under section 357YO(2) deducted a sum representing corporation tax from the interest, or b a sum has been paid as corporation tax in respect of the interest under section 357YQ, that sum is treated for all purposes as if it had never been paid to, or deducted or held by, the Commissioners as or in respect of corporation tax. 4 Any adjustments are to be made that are necessary in accordance with this section; and any time limits applying to the making of adjustments are to be ignored. 5 In this section\u2014 \u201c final determination \u201d has the same meaning as in section 357YC; \u201c late appeal \u201d means an appeal which is made by reason of a court giving leave to appeal out of time. Countering effect of avoidance arrangements 357YH 1 Any restitution-related tax advantages that would (in the absence of this section) arise from relevant avoidance arrangements are to be counteracted by the making of such adjustments as are just and reasonable in relation to amounts to be brought into account for the purposes of this Part. 2 Any adjustments required to be made under this section (whether or not by an officer of Revenue and Customs) may be made by way of an assessment, the modification of an assessment, amendment or otherwise. 3 For the meaning of  \u201crelevant avoidance arrangements\u201d and  \u201crestitution-related tax advantage\u201d see section 357YI. Interpretation of section 357YH 357YI 1 This section applies for the interpretation of section 357YH (and this section). 2 \u201cArrangements\u201d include any agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions (whether or not legally enforceable). 3 Arrangements are  \u201crelevant avoidance arrangements\u201d if their main purpose, or one of their main purposes, is to enable a company to obtain a tax advantage in relation to the application of the charge to tax at the restitution payments rate. 4 But arrangements are not  \u201crelevant avoidance arrangements\u201d if the obtaining of any tax advantages that would (in the absence of section 357YH) arise from them can reasonably be regarded as consistent with wholly commercial arrangements. 5 \u201c Tax advantage \u201d includes\u2014 a a repayment of tax or increased repayment of tax, b the avoidance or reduction of a charge to tax or an assessment to tax, c the avoidance of a possible assessment to tax, d deferral of a payment of tax or advancement of a repayment of tax, or e the avoidance of an obligation to deduct or account for tax. 6 In subsection (5)(b) and (c) the references to avoidance or reduction include an avoidance or reduction effected by receipts accruing in such a way that the recipient does not bear tax on them as restitution interest under this Part. Examples of results that may indicate exclusion not applicable 357YJ Each of the following is an example of something which might indicate that arrangements whose main purpose, or one of whose main purposes, is to enable a company to obtain a restitution-related tax advantage are not excluded by section 357YI(4) from being  \u201c relevant avoidance arrangements \u201d for the purposes of section 357YH\u2014 a the elimination or reduction for the purposes of this Part of amounts chargeable as restitution interest arising to the company in connection with a particular claim, if for economic purposes other or greater profits arise to the company in connection with the claim; b preventing or delaying the recognition as an item of profit or loss of an amount that would apart from the arrangements be recognised in the company's accounts as an item of profit or loss, or be so recognised earlier; c ensuring that a receipt is treated for accounting purposes in a way in which it would not have been treated in the absence of some other transaction forming part of the arrangements. CHAPTER 2 Application of restitution payments rate Corporation tax rate on restitution interest 357YK 1 Corporation tax is charged on restitution interest at the restitution payments rate. 2 The  \u201crestitution payments rate\u201d is 45%. Exclusion of reliefs, set-offs etc 357YL 1 Under subsection (3) of section 4 (amounts to which rates of corporation tax applied) the amounts to be added together to find a company's  \u201ctotal profits\u201d do not include amounts of restitution interest on which corporation tax is chargeable under this Part. 2 No reliefs or set-offs may be given against so much of the corporation tax to which a company is liable for an accounting period as is equal to the amount of corporation tax chargeable on the company for the period at the restitution payments rate. 3 In subsection (2)  \u201c reliefs and set-offs \u201d includes, but is not restricted to, those listed in the second step of paragraph 8(1) of Schedule 18 to FA 1998. 4 Amounts of income tax or corporation tax, or any other amounts, which may be set off against a company's overall liability to income tax and corporation tax for an accounting period may not be set off against so much of the corporation tax to which the company is liable for the period as is equal to the amount of corporation tax chargeable at the restitution payments rate. CHAPTER 3 Migration, transfers of rights etc Assignment of rights to person not chargeable to corporation tax 357YM 1 Subsection (4) applies if\u2014 a a company which is within the charge to corporation tax under this Part (\u201c the transferor \u201d) transfers to a person who is not within the charge to corporation tax under this Part a right in respect of a claim, or possible claim, for restitution, b the transfer is made on or after 21 October 2015, and c conditions A and B are met. 2 Condition A is that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the transfer is to secure a tax advantage for any person in relation to the application of the charge to tax on restitution interest under this Part. 3 Condition B is that as a result of that transfer (or that transfer together with further transfers of the rights) restitution interest arises to a person who is not within the charge to corporation tax under this Part. 4 Any restitution interest which arises as mentioned in Condition B is treated for corporation tax purposes as restitution interest arising to the transferor. 5 A person is  \u201cwithin the charge to corporation tax under this Part\u201d if the person\u2014 a is a UK resident company, and b would not be exempt from corporation tax on restitution interest (were such interest to arise to it). 6 In this section  \u201c tax advantage \u201d has the meaning given by section 357YI. Migration of company with claim to restitution interest 357YN 1 This section applies where\u2014 a restitution interest arises to a non-UK resident company, b the rights in respect of which the company is entitled to the restitution interest had (to any extent) accrued when the company ceased to be UK resident, and c the company's main purpose, or one of its main purposes, in changing its residence was to secure a tax advantage for any person in relation to the application of the charge to tax on restitution interest under this Part. 2 The company is treated as a UK resident company for the purposes of the application of this Part in relation to so much of that restitution interest as is attributable to relevant accrued rights. 3 \u201c Relevant accrued rights \u201d means rights which had accrued to the company when it ceased to be UK resident. 4 The company is to be treated for the purposes of sections 185 and 187 of  TCGA  1992 as not having disposed of its assets on ceasing to be resident in the United Kingdom, so far as its assets at that time consisted of rights to receive restitution interest. 5 Any adjustments that are necessary as a result of subsection (4) are to be made; and any time limits for the making of adjustments are to be ignored for this purpose. CHAPTER 4 Payment and collection of tax on restitution interest Duty to deduct tax from payments of restitution interest 357YO 1 Subsection (2) applies if the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs pay an amount of interest in relation to which Conditions 1 and 2 are met and\u2014 a the amount is (when the payment is made) restitution interest on which a company is chargeable to corporation tax under this Part, or b a company would be chargeable to corporation tax under this Part on the interest paid if it were (at that time) restitution interest. 2 The Commissioners must, on making the payment\u2014 a deduct from it a sum representing corporation tax on the amount at the restitution payments rate, and b give the company a written notice stating the amount of the gross payment and the amount deducted from it. 3 Condition 1 is that the Commissioners are liable to pay, or have agreed or determined to pay, the interest in respect of a company's claim for restitution with regard to\u2014 a the payment of an amount to the Commissioners under a mistake of law relating to a taxation matter, or b the unlawful collection by the Commissioners of an amount in respect of taxation. 4 Condition 2 is that the interest is not limited to simple interest at a statutory rate. In determining whether or not this condition is met, all amounts which the Commissioners are liable to pay, or have agreed or determined to pay in respect of the claim are to be considered together. 5 For the purposes of Condition 1 it does not matter whether the Commissioners are liable to pay, or (as the case may be) have agreed or determined to pay, the interest\u2014 a pursuant to a judgment or order of a court, b as an interim payment in court proceedings, c under an agreement to settle a claim, or d in any other circumstances. 6 For the purposes of subsection (2) the restitution payments rate is to be applied to the gross payment, that is to the payment before deduction of a sum representing corporation tax in accordance with this section. 7 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a \u201c interest \u201d includes an amount equivalent to interest, and b an amount which the Commissioners pay as mentioned in subsection (1) is  \u201cequivalent to interest\u201d so far as it is an amount determined by reference to the time value of money. Treatment of amounts deducted under section 357YO 357YP 1 An amount deducted from an interest payment in accordance with section 357YO(2) is treated for all purposes as paid by the company mentioned in section 357YO(1) on account of the company's liability, or potential liability, to corporation tax charged on the interest payment, as restitution interest, under this Part. 2 Subsections (3) and (4) apply if\u2014 a the Commissioners have, on paying an amount which is not (when the payment is made) restitution interest, made a deduction under section 357YO(2) from the gross payment (see section 357YO(6)), and b a company becomes liable to repay the net amount to the Commissioners, or it otherwise becomes clear that the gross amount cannot, or will not, become restitution interest. 3 If the condition in subsection (2)(b) is met in circumstances where the company is not liable to repay the net amount to the Commissioners, the Commissioners must\u2014 a repay to the company the amount treated under subsection (1) as paid by the company, and b make any other necessary adjustments; and any time limits applying to the making of adjustments are to be ignored. 4 If the condition in subsection (2)(b) is met by virtue of a company becoming liable to repay to the Commissioners the amount paid as mentioned in subsection (2)(a)\u2014 a this Part has effect as if the company were liable to repay the gross payment to the Commissioners, and b the amount deducted by the Commissioners as mentioned in subsection (2)(a) is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as money repaid by the company in partial satisfaction of its liability to repay the gross amount. 5 Subsections (3) and (4) have effect with the appropriate modifications if the condition in subsection (2)(b) is met in relation to part but not the whole of the gross amount mentioned in subsection (2)(a). 6 In this section  \u201c the net amount \u201d, in relation to a payment made under deduction of tax in accordance with section 357YO(2), means the amount paid after deduction of tax. Assessment of tax chargeable on restitution interest 357YQ 1 An officer of Revenue and Customs may make an assessment of the amounts in which, in the officer's opinion, a company is chargeable to corporation tax under this Part for a period specified in the assessment. 2 Notice of an assessment under this section must be served on the company, stating the date on which the assessment is issued. 3 An assessment may include an assessment of the amount of restitution income arising to the company in the period and any other matters relevant to the calculation of the amounts in which the company is chargeable to corporation tax under this Part for the period. 4 Notice of an assessment under this section may be accompanied by notice of any determination by an officer of Revenue and Customs relating to the dates on which amounts of tax become due and payable under this section or to amounts treated under section 357YP as paid on account of corporation tax. 5 The company must pay the amount assessed as payable for the accounting period by the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the date on which the company is given notice of the assessment. Interest on excessive amounts withheld 357YR 1 If an amount deducted under section 357YO(2) in respect of an amount of interest exceeds the amount which should have been deducted, the Commissioners are liable to pay interest on the excess from the material date until the date on which the excess is repaid. 2 The  \u201cmaterial date\u201d is the date on which tax was deducted from the interest. 3 Interest under subsection (1) is to be paid at the rate applicable under section 178 of FA 1989. Appeal against deduction 357YS 1 An appeal may be brought against the deduction by the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs from a payment of a sum representing corporation tax in compliance, or purported compliance, with section 357YO(2). 2 Notice of appeal must be given\u2014 a in writing, b within 30 days after the giving of the notice under section 357YO(2). Amounts taxed at restitution payments rate to be outside instalment payments regime 357YT For the purposes of regulations under section 59E of  TMA  1970 (further provision as to when corporation tax due and payable), tax charged at the restitution payments rate is to be disregarded in determining the amount of corporation tax payable by a company for an accounting period. CHAPTER 5 Supplementary provisions Interpretation 357YU 1 In this Part  \u201c court \u201d includes a tribunal. 2 In this Part  \u201cstatutory rate\u201d (in relation to interest) means a rate which is equal to a rate specified\u2014 a for purposes relating to taxation, and b in, or in a provision made under, an Act.

In this subsection, in a case where the sum referred to in subsection (2) arises to a company connected with A, the reference to a person connected with A does not include that company. 4 Where\u2014 a section 809EZDB of ITA 2007 has been disapplied in relation to a sum of deferred carried interest by virtue of subsection (2), b the sum ceases to be deferred carried interest in relation to A, and c the sum does not in any event arise to A apart from this subsection, the sum is to be regarded as arising to A at the time it ceases to be deferred carried interest. 5 But subsection (4) does not apply if\u2014 a none of the enjoyment conditions is met in relation to the sum when it ceases to be deferred carried interest, and b there is no reasonable likelihood that any of those conditions will ever be met in relation to the sum. 6 The enjoyment conditions are\u2014 a the sum, or part of the sum, is in fact so dealt with by any person as to be calculated at some time to enure for the benefit of A or a person connected with A; b the sum's ceasing to be deferred carried interest in relation to A operates to increase the value to A or a person connected with A of any assets which\u2014 i A or the connected person holds, or ii are held for the benefit of A or the connected person; c A or a person connected with A receives or is entitled to receive at any time any benefit provided or to be provided out of the sum or part of the sum; d A or a person connected with A may become entitled to the beneficial enjoyment of the sum or part of the sum if one or more powers are exercised or successively exercised (and for these purposes it does not matter who may exercise the powers or whether they are exercisable with or without the consent of another person); e A or a person connected with A is able in any manner to control directly or indirectly the application of the sum or part of the sum. In this subsection, in a case where the sum referred to in subsection (2) arises to a company connected with A, references to a person connected with A do not include that company. 7 In determining whether any of the enjoyment conditions is met in relation to a sum or part of a sum\u2014 a regard must be had to the substantial result and effect of all the relevant circumstances, and b all benefits which may at any time accrue to a person as a result of the sum ceasing to be deferred carried interest in relation to A must be taken into account, irrespective of\u2014 i the nature or form of the benefits, or ii whether the person has legal or equitable rights in respect of the benefits. 8 The enjoyment condition in subsection (6)(b), (c) or (d) is to be treated as not met if it would be met only by reason of A holding shares or an interest in shares in a company. 9 The enjoyment condition in subsection (6)(a) or (e) is to be treated as not met if the sum referred to in subsection (2) arises to a company connected with A and\u2014 a the company is liable to pay corporation tax in respect of its profits and the sum is included in the computation of those profits, or b paragraph (a) does not apply but\u2014 i the company is a CFC and the exemption in Chapter 14 of Part 9A of TIOPA 2010 applies for the accounting period in which the sum arises, or ii the company is not a CFC but, if it were, that exemption would apply for that period. In this subsection  \u201c CFC \u201d has the same meaning as in Part 9A of TIOPA 2010. 10 But subsections (8) and (9) do not apply if the sum referred to in subsection (2) arises to the company referred to in subsection (2)(a) or the person referred to in subsection (2)(b) as part of arrangements where\u2014 a it is reasonable to assume that in the absence of the arrangements the sum or part of the sum would have arisen to A or an individual connected with A, and b it is reasonable to assume that the arrangements have as their main purpose, or one of their main purposes, the avoidance of a liability to pay income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax or corporation tax. 11 The condition in subsection (10)(b) is to be regarded as met in a case where the sum is applied directly or indirectly as an investment in a collective investment scheme. 12 Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to any sum in relation to which the condition in subsection (8)(b) of section 809EZDB is met by virtue of subsection (9) of that section. 13 Subsection (2) also does not apply if\u2014 a it is reasonable to assume that the deferral referred to in subsection (3)(a) or (b) is not the effect of genuine commercial arrangements, or b that deferral is the effect of such arrangements but it is reasonable to assume that the arrangements have as their main purpose, or one of their main purposes, the avoidance of a liability to pay income tax, capital gains tax, corporation tax or inheritance tax. 14 In subsection (13),  \u201c genuine commercial arrangements \u201d means arrangements involving A (alone or jointly with others performing investment management services) and external investors in the investment scheme. 15 Section 993 of ITA 2007 (meaning of  \u201cconnected\u201d) applies for the purposes of this section but as if\u2014 a subsection (4) of that section were omitted, and b partners in a partnership in which A is also a partner were not  \u201cassociates\u201d of A for the purposes of sections 450 and 451 of CTA 2010 (\u201ccontrol\u201d).

(judgment debts to carry interest), and b any order under section 74 of the County Courts Act 1984 (interest on judgment debts etc). 3 The relevant enactment is to have effect in relation to the tax-related judgment debt as if for the rate specified in section 17(1) of the Judgments Act 1838 and any other rate specified in an order under section 74 of the County Courts Act 1984 there were substituted\u2014 a in the case of a sum payable to the Commissioners, the late payment interest rate provided for in regulations made by the Treasury under section 103(1) of FA 2009, and b in the

or to provide for a rate of interest which is lower than (and incapable of exceeding) that for which the subsection provides. 5 If section 44A of the Administration of Justice Act 1970 (interest on judgment debts expressed otherwise than in sterling), or any corresponding provision made under section 74 of the County Courts Act 1984 in relation to the county court, applies to a tax-related

this section is the rate provided for in the regulations. 9 Regulations under subsection (8)\u2014 a may make different provision for different purposes, b may either themselves specify a rate of

effect for periods beginning on or after a day determined in accordance with the regulations (\u201c the effective date \u201d) regardless of\u2014 i the date of the judgment or order in question, and
