allowed under Chapter 2 or 5 of Part 5 in respect of those amounts. 4 Condition B is that neither the payer nor any other person operating the system knows or suspects, or could reasonably be expected to know or suspect\u2014 a that the employee has not incurred and paid an amount in respect of the expenses, or b that a deduction from the employee's earnings would not be allowed under Chapter 2 or 5 of Part 5 in respect of the amount. 5 \u201c Relevant salary sacrifice arrangements \u201d, in relation to an employee to whom an amount is paid or reimbursed in respect of expenses, means

for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, or b it is calculated and paid or reimbursed in accordance with an approval given under section 289B. 7 Regulations made under subsection (6)(a) may make

Revocation of approvals 289C 1 An officer of Revenue and Customs may, if in the officer's opinion there is reason to do so, revoke an approval given under section 289B by giving a further notice (a  \u201crevocation notice\u201d) to either or both of the following\u2014 a the person who applied for the approval, and b the person who is paying or reimbursing expenses in accordance with the approval. 2 A revocation notice may revoke the approval from\u2014 a the day on which the approval took effect, or b a later day specified in the notice. 3 A revocation under subsection (1) may be in relation to all expenses or expenses of a description specified in the revocation notice. 4 If the revocation notice revokes the approval from the day on which the approval took effect\u2014 a any liability to tax that would have arisen in respect of the payment or reimbursement of expenses if the approval had never been given in relation to such expenses is to be treated as having arisen, and b any person who has made, and any employee who has received, a payment or reimbursement of expenses calculated in accordance with the approval must make all the returns which they would have had to make if the approval had never been given in relation to such expenses. 5 If the revocation notice revokes the approval from a later day\u2014 a any liability to tax that would have arisen in respect of the payment or reimbursement of expenses if the approval had ceased to have effect on that day in relation to such expenses is to be treated as having arisen, and b any person who has made, and any employee who has received, a payment or reimbursement of expenses calculated in accordance with the approval must make all the returns which they would have had to make if the approval had ceased to have effect in relation to such expenses on that day. Exemption for other benefits 289D 1 No liability to income tax arises by virtue of any provision of the benefits code in respect of an amount (\u201camount A\u201d) treated as earnings of an employee as a result of the provision of a benefit if\u2014 a an amount equal to amount A would (ignoring this section) be allowed as a deduction from the employee's earnings under Chapter 3 of Part 5 in respect of the provision of the benefit, and b the benefit is not provided pursuant to relevant salary sacrifice arrangements. 2 \u201c Relevant salary sacrifice arrangements \u201d, in relation to an employee to whom a benefit is provided, means arrangements (whenever made, whether before or after the employment began) under which\u2014 a the employee gives up the right to receive an amount of general earnings or specific employment income in return for the provision of the benefit, or b the amount of other general earnings or specific employment income received by the employee depends on the provision of the benefit. Anti-avoidance 289E 1 This section applies if conditions A to C are met. 2 Condition A is that, pursuant to arrangements, an amount\u2014 a is paid or reimbursed to an employee in respect of expenses, or b is treated as earnings of an employee as a result of the provision of a benefit, which, in the absence of this section, would have been exempt from income tax. 3 Condition B is that, in the absence of those arrangements, the employee would have received a greater amount of general earnings or specific employment income in respect of which\u2014 a tax would have been chargeable, or b national insurance contributions would have been payable (whether by the employee or another person). 4 Condition C is that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the arrangements is the avoidance of tax or national insurance contributions. 5 If this section applies\u2014 a the exemption conferred by section 289A does not apply in respect of the amount paid or reimbursed as mentioned in subsection (2)(a), and b the exemption conferred by section 289D does not apply in respect of the amount treated as earnings as mentioned in subsection (2)(b). 6 In this section  \u201c arrangements \u201d includes any scheme, transaction or series of transactions, agreement or understanding, whether or not legally enforceable. 2 The amendment made by this section has effect for the tax year 2016-17 and subsequent tax years."}, {"act": "Finance Act 2015", "year": 2015, "section": "12", "section_title": "Abolition of dispensation regime", "section_text": "12 1 ITEPA 2003 is amended as follows. 2 Omit section 65 (dispensations relating to benefits for certain employees). 3 Omit section 96 (dispensations relating to vouchers or credit-tokens). 4 Accordingly\u2014 a in section 95 (disregard for money, services or goods obtained), omit subsection (1)(b) and the  \u201cor\u201d before it, and b in Schedule 7 (transitionals and savings), omit paragraphs 15, 16, 19 and 20 and the italic headings before paragraphs 15 and 19. 5 The amendments made by this section have effect for the tax year 2016-17 and subsequent tax years. 6 The repeal of sections 65 and 96 of ITEPA 2003 does not affect the power of an officer of Revenue and Customs to revoke a pre-commencement dispensation from a date earlier than 6 April 2016. 7 Accordingly, sections 65(6) to (9) and 96(5) to (8) of ITEPA 2003 continue to have effect in relation to a pre-commencement dispensation. 8 In this section  \u201c pre-commencement dispensation \u201d means a dispensation given (or treated as given) under section 65 or 96 of ITEPA 2003 which is in force immediately before 6 April 2016."}, {"act": "Finance Act 2015", "year": 2015, "section": "13", "section_title": "Extension of benefits code except in relation to certain ministers of religion", "section_text": "13 1 Omit Chapter 11 of Part 3 of ITEPA 2003 (taxable benefits: exclusion of lower-paid employments from parts of benefits code). 2 In Part 4 of that Act (employment income: exemptions), after section 290B insert\u2014 Provisions of benefits code not applicable to lower-paid ministers of religion 290C 1 This section applies where a person is in employment which is lower-paid employment as a minister of religion in relation to a tax year. 2 No liability to income tax arises in respect of the person in relation to the tax year by virtue of any of the following Chapters of the benefits code\u2014 a Chapter 3 (taxable benefits: expenses payments); b Chapter 6 (taxable benefits: cars, vans and related benefits); c Chapter 7 (taxable benefits: loans); d Chapter 10 (taxable benefits: residual liability to charge). 3 Subsection (2)\u2014 a means that in any of those Chapters a reference to an employee does not include an employee whose employment is within the exclusion in that subsection, if the context is such that the reference is to an employee in relation to whom the Chapter applies, but b does not restrict the meaning of references to employees in other contexts. 4 Subsection (2) has effect subject to\u2014 a section 188(2) (discharge of loan: where employment becomes lower-paid), and b section 290G (employment in two or more related employments).

This is subject to subsections (3) to (8) (sums where no significant risk of not arising); and see also section 809EZD (sums treated as carried interest). 2 A sum which arises to the individual under the arrangements does so by way of  \u201cprofit-related return\u201d if under the arrangements\u2014 a the sum is to, or may, arise only if\u2014 i there are profits for a period on the investments, or on particular investments, made for the purposes of the scheme, or ii there are profits arising from a disposal of the investments, or of particular investments, made for those purposes, b the amount of the sum which is to, or may, arise is variable, to a substantial extent, by reference to those profits, and c returns to external investors are also determined by reference to those profits; but where any part of the sum does not meet these conditions, that part is not to be regarded as arising by way of  \u201cprofit-related return\u201d. 3 Where\u2014 a one or more sums (\u201cactual sums\u201d) arise to the individual under the arrangements by way of profit-related return in a tax year, and b there was no significant risk that a sum of at least a certain amount (\u201cthe minimum amount\u201d) would not arise to the individual, so much of the actual sum, or of the aggregate of the actual sums, as is equal to the minimum amount is not  \u201ccarried interest\u201d. (See subsections (7) and (8) as to how the minimum amount is to be apportioned between the actual sums where more than one actual sum arises in the tax year.) 4 For the purposes of subsection (3)(b) assess the risk both\u2014 a in relation to each actual sum (and the investments to which it relates) individually, taking into account also any other sums that might have arisen to the individual under the arrangements instead of that sum, and b in relation to the actual sum or sums and any other sums that might have arisen to the individual under the arrangements by way of profit-related return in the tax year (and the investments to which all those sums relate) taken as a whole; (so that, in a particular case, some of the minimum amount may arise by assessing the risk in accordance with paragraph (a) and some by assessing it in accordance with paragraph (b)). 5 For the purposes of subsection (3)(b) assess the risk as at the latest of\u2014 a the time when the individual becomes party to the arrangements, b the time when the individual begins to perform investment management services directly or indirectly in respect of the scheme under the arrangements, and c the time when a material change is made to the arrangements so far as relating to the sums which are to, or may, arise to the individual. 6 For the purposes of subsection (3)(b) ignore any risk that a sum is prevented from arising to the individual (by reason of insolvency or otherwise). 7 Where more than one actual sum arises in the tax year, the minimum amount is to be apportioned between the actual sums as follows for the purposes of subsection (3)\u2014 a so much of the minimum amount as is attributable to a particular actual sum is to be apportioned to that actual sum, and b so much of the minimum amount as is not attributable to any particular actual sum is to be apportioned between the actual sums on a just and reasonable basis. 8 For the purpose of subsection (7) any part of the minimum amount is attributable to a particular actual sum to the extent that there was no significant risk that that part would not arise to the individual in relation to that actual sum, assessing the risk in accordance with subsection (4)(a). Sums treated as  \u201ccarried interest\u201d for purposes of section 809EZB 809EZD 1 A sum falling within subsection (2) or (3)\u2014 a is to be assumed to meet the requirements of section 809EZC, and b accordingly, is to be treated as constituting  \u201c carried interest \u201d for the purposes of section 809EZB. 2 A sum falls within this subsection if, under the arrangements, it is to, or may, arise to the individual out of profits on the investments made for the purposes of the scheme, but only after\u2014 a all, or substantially all, of the investments in the scheme made by the participants have been repaid to the participants, and b each external investor has received a preferred return on all, or substantially all, of the investor's investments in the scheme. 3 A sum falls within this subsection if, under the arrangements, it is to, or may, arise to the individual out of profits on a particular investment made for the purposes of the scheme, but only after\u2014 a all, or substantially all, of the relevant investments made by participants have been repaid to those participants, and b each of those participants who is an external investor has received a preferred return on all, or substantially all, of the investor's relevant investments; and for this purpose  \u201c relevant investments \u201d means those investments in the scheme to which the particular investment made for the purposes of the scheme is attributable. 4 In this section  \u201c preferred return \u201d means a return of not less than the amount that would be payable on the investment by way of interest if\u2014 a compound interest were payable on the investment for the whole of the period during which it was invested in the scheme, and b the interest were calculated at a rate of 6% per annum, with annual rests. Interpretation of Chapter 809EZE 1 In this Chapter\u2014 \u201c arrangements \u201d includes any agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions (whether or not legally enforceable); \u201c collective investment scheme \u201d has the meaning given by section 235 of  FISMA  2000; \u201c external investor \u201d, in relation to an investment scheme and any arrangements, means a participant in the scheme other than\u2014 an individual who performs investment management services directly or indirectly in respect of the scheme, or a person through whom sums are to, or may, arise directly or indirectly to such an individual from the scheme under the arrangements; \u201c investment management services \u201d, in relation to an investment scheme, includes\u2014 seeking funds for the purposes of the scheme from participants or potential participants, researching potential investments to be made for the purposes of the scheme, acquiring, managing or disposing of property for the purposes of the scheme, and acting for the purposes of the scheme with a view to assisting a body in which the scheme has made an investment to raise funds; \u201c investment trust \u201d means a company in relation to which conditions A to C in section 1158 of CTA 2010 are met (or treated as met); and for this purpose  \u201c company \u201d has the meaning given by section 1121 of CTA 2010; \u201c market value \u201d has the same meaning as in  TCGA  1992 (see sections 272 and 273 of that Act); \u201cparticipant\u201d\u2014 in relation to a collective investment scheme, is construed in accordance with section 235 of FISMA 2000; in relation to an investment trust, means a member of the investment trust; \u201c profits \u201d, in relation to an investment made for the purposes of an investment scheme, means profits (including unrealised profits) arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of the investment (taking into account items of a revenue nature and items of a capital nature). 2 In this Chapter a reference to an investment made by a person in an investment scheme is a reference to a contribution by the person (whether by way of capital, loan or otherwise) towards the property subject to the scheme (but does not include a sum committed but not yet invested). 3 For the purposes of subsection (2) a person who holds a share in an investment scheme which is a company limited by shares and who acquired the share from a person other than the scheme is to be taken to have made a contribution towards the property subject to the scheme equal to\u2014 a the consideration given by the person for the acquisition of the share, or b if less, the market value of the share at the time of the acquisition. 4 In this Chapter, in relation to an investment scheme which is a company limited by shares\u2014 a references to a repayment of, or a return on, an investment in the scheme include a repayment of, or a return on, an investment represented by a share in the scheme resulting from\u2014 i the purchase of the share by the scheme, ii the redemption of the share by the scheme, iii the distribution of assets in respect of the share on the winding up of the scheme, or iv any similar process; b references to a return on an investment in the scheme include a dividend or similar distribution in respect of a share in the scheme representing the investment. Disguised investment management fees: anti-avoidance 809EZF In determining whether section 809EZA applies in relation to an individual, no regard is to be had to any arrangements the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which is to secure that that section does not apply in relation to\u2014 a the individual, or b the individual and one or more other individuals. Disguised investment management fees: avoidance of double taxation 809EZG 1 This section applies where\u2014 a income tax is charged on an individual by virtue of section 809EZA in respect of a disguised fee, and b at any time, a tax (whether income tax or another tax) is charged on the individual otherwise than by virtue of section 809EZA in relation to the disguised fee. 2 This section also applies where\u2014 a income tax is charged on an individual by virtue of section 809EZA in respect of a disguised fee which arises to the individual under the arrangements by way of a loan or advance, b at any time, a tax (whether income tax or another tax) is charged on the individual in relation to another sum which arises to the individual under the arrangements, and c some or all of the loan or advance has to be repaid as a result of the other sum having arisen to the individual. 3 In order to avoid a double charge to tax, the individual may make a claim for one or more consequential adjustments to be made in respect of the tax charged as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) or (2)(b). 4 On a claim under this section an officer of Revenue and Customs must make such of the consequential adjustments claimed (if any) as are just and reasonable. 5 The value of any consequential adjustments must not exceed the lesser of the income tax charged on the individual as mentioned in subsection (1)(a) or (2)(a) and\u2014 a where subsection (1) applies, the tax charged as mentioned in subsection (1)(b); b where subsection (2) applies, the tax charged as mentioned in subsection (2)(b) in relation to so much of the other sum as does not exceed the amount of the loan or advance that has to be repaid as mentioned in subsection (2)(c). 6 Consequential adjustments may be made\u2014 a in respect of any period, b by way of an assessment, the modification of an assessment, the amendment of a claim, or otherwise, and c despite any time limit imposed by or under any enactment. Powers to amend Chapter 809EZH 1 The Treasury may by regulations amend this Chapter\u2014 a so as to change the definition of  \u201c investment scheme \u201d for the purposes of this Chapter; b so as to change the definition of  \u201cparticipant\u201d for those purposes; c so as to change what is  \u201c carried interest \u201d for the purposes of section 809EZB. 2 Regulations under this section may\u2014 a make different provision for different purposes, and b contain incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision and savings. 3 A statutory instrument containing regulations under this section to which subsection (4) applies may not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before and approved by a resolution of the House of Commons. 4 This subsection applies if the regulations contain any provision which has or may have the effect of increasing any person's liability to tax. 5 Any other statutory instrument containing regulations under this section is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the House of Commons. 2 In section 2 of ITA 2007 (overview of Act), in subsection (13)\u2014 a after paragraph (h) insert\u2014 ha

Eligibility conditions for deferred entrepreneurs' relief 169U 1 Section 169V applies if, ignoring the operation of section 169V(2)(b), each of the following conditions is met. 2 The first condition is that a chargeable gain (\u201cthe first eventual gain\u201d) accrues as a result of the operation of\u2014 paragraph 4 of Schedule 5B (enterprise investment scheme), or paragraph 5 of Schedule 8B (investments in social enterprises). 3 If the first condition is met, the paragraph and Schedule mentioned in subsection (2) that apply in the case are referred to in this section, and section 169V, as  \u201cthe relevant paragraph\u201d and  \u201cthe applicable Schedule\u201d. 4 The second condition is\u2014 a that the first eventual gain accrues in a case in which the original gain would, but for the operation of the applicable Schedule, have accrued on a relevant business disposal, or b where the first eventual gain accrues in a case in which the original gain would, but for the operation of the applicable Schedule, have accrued as a result of the operation of either of the paragraphs mentioned in subsection (2), that the underlying disposal is a relevant business disposal. 5 The third condition is that a claim for entrepreneurs' relief in respect of the first eventual gain is made, on or before the first anniversary of the 31 January following the tax year in which the first eventual gain accrues, by the individual who made the disposal mentioned in subsection (4)(a) or (b). 6 The fourth condition is that the first eventual gain is the first gain to accrue in the case as a result of the operation of the relevant paragraph. 7 In subsection (4)  \u201c the underlying disposal \u201d means the disposal (not being a disposal within paragraph 3 of Schedule 5B or paragraph 6 of Schedule 8B) by virtue of which Schedule 5B or 8B has effect. 8 For the purposes of subsection (4), whether the disposal on which the original gain would have accrued is a relevant business disposal, or whether the underlying disposal is a relevant business disposal, is to be decided according to the law applicable to disposals made at the time the disposal was made. 9 In this section\u2014 \u201c the original gain \u201d, in relation to a particular case, has the same meaning as in the applicable Schedule, \u201c relevant business asset \u201d has the meaning given by section 169L, and \u201c relevant business disposal \u201d means\u2014 a disposal\u2014 within section 169H(2)(a) or (c) (qualifying business disposals), and consisting of the disposal of (or of interests in) shares in or securities of a company, or a disposal of relevant business assets which is comprised in a disposal\u2014 within section 169H(2)(a) or (c), and not consisting of the disposal of (or of interests in) shares in or securities of a company.

Amount of penalty 2 1 If the contravention is deliberate and concealed, the amount of the penalty is the maximum amount (see paragraph 10). 2 If the contravention is deliberate but not concealed, the amount of the penalty is 70% of the maximum amount. 3 In any other case, the amount of the penalty is 30% of the maximum amount. 4 The contravention is\u2014 a \u201cdeliberate and concealed\u201d if the contravention is deliberate and P makes arrangements to conceal the contravention, and b \u201cdeliberate but not concealed\u201d if the contravention is deliberate but P does not make arrangements to conceal the contravention. Reductions for disclosure 3 1 Paragraph 4 provides for reductions in penalties under this Schedule where P discloses a contravention. 2 P discloses a contravention by\u2014 a telling the Commissioners about it, b giving the Commissioners reasonable help in identifying any other contraventions of section 88C(1) or 88F of which P is aware, and c allowing the Commissioners access to records for the purpose of identifying such contraventions. 3 Disclosure of a contravention\u2014 a is  \u201cunprompted\u201d if made at a time when P has no reason to believe that the Commissioners have discovered or are about to discover the contravention, and b otherwise, is  \u201cprompted\u201d. 4 In relation to disclosure  \u201c quality \u201d includes timing, nature and extent. 4 1 Where P discloses a contravention, the Commissioners must reduce the penalty to one that reflects the quality of the disclosure. 2 If the disclosure is prompted, the penalty may not be reduced below\u2014 a in the case of a contravention that is deliberate and concealed, 50% of the maximum amount, b in the case of a contravention that is deliberate but not concealed, 35% of the maximum amount, and c in any other case, 20% of the maximum amount. 3 If the disclosure is unprompted, the penalty may not be reduced below\u2014 a in the case of a contravention that is deliberate and concealed, 30% of the maximum amount, b in the case of a contravention that is deliberate but not concealed, 20% of the maximum amount, and c in any other case, 10% of the maximum amount. Special reduction 5 1 If the Commissioners think it right because of special circumstances, they may reduce a penalty under this Schedule. 2 In sub-paragraph (1)  \u201c special circumstances \u201d does not include ability to pay. 3 In sub-paragraph (1) the reference to reducing a penalty includes a reference to\u2014 a staying a penalty, and b agreeing a compromise in relation to proceedings for a penalty. Assessment 6 1 Where P becomes liable for a penalty under this Schedule, the Commissioners must\u2014 a assess the penalty, b notify P, and c state in the notice the contravention in respect of which the penalty is assessed. 2 A penalty under this Schedule must be paid before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which notification of the penalty is issued. 3 An assessment is to be treated as an amount of duty due from P under this Act and may be recovered accordingly. 4 An assessment of a penalty under this Schedule may not be made later than one year after evidence of facts sufficient in the opinion of the Commissioners to indicate the contravention comes to their knowledge. 5 Two or more contraventions may be treated by the Commissioners as a single contravention for the purposes of assessing a penalty under this Schedule. Reasonable excuse 7 1 Liability to a penalty does not arise under this Schedule in respect of a contravention which is not deliberate if P satisfies the Commissioners or (on an appeal made to the appeal tribunal) the tribunal that there is a reasonable excuse for the contravention. 2 For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1), where P relies on any other person to do anything, that is not a reasonable excuse unless P took reasonable care to avoid the contravention. Companies: officer's liability 8 1 Where a penalty under this Schedule is payable by a company in respect of a contravention which was attributable to an officer of the company, the officer is liable to pay such portion of the penalty (which may be 100%) as the Commissioners may specify by written notice to the officer. 2 Sub-paragraph (1) does not allow the Commissioners to recover more than 100% of a penalty. 3 In the application of sub-paragraph (1) to a body corporate other than a limited liability partnership,  \u201c officer \u201d means\u2014 a a director (including a shadow director within the meaning of section 251 of the Companies Act 2006), b a manager, and c a secretary. 4 In the application of sub-paragraph (1) to a limited liability partnership,  \u201c officer \u201d means a member. 5 In the application of sub-paragraph (1) in any other case,  \u201c officer \u201d means\u2014 a a director, b a manager, c a secretary, and d any other person managing or purporting to manage any of the company's affairs. 6 Where the Commissioners have specified a portion of a penalty in a notice given to an officer under sub-paragraph (1)\u2014 a paragraph 5 applies to the specified portion as to a penalty, b the officer must pay the specified portion before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the notice is given, c sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) of paragraph 6 apply as if the notice were an assessment of a penalty, and d paragraph 9 applies as if the officer were liable to a penalty. 7 In this paragraph  \u201c company \u201d means any body corporate or unincorporated association, but does not include a partnership. Double jeopardy 9 P is not liable to a penalty under this Schedule in respect of a contravention in respect of which P has been convicted of an offence. The maximum amount 10 1 In this Schedule  \u201c the maximum amount \u201d means \u00a310,000. 2 If it appears to the Treasury that there has been a change in the value of money since the last relevant date, they may by regulations substitute for the sum for the time being specified in sub-paragraph (1) such other sum as appears to them to be justified by the change. 3 In sub-paragraph (2),  \u201c relevant date \u201d means\u2014 a the date on which the Finance Act 2015 is passed, and b each date on which the power conferred by that sub-paragraph has been exercised. 4 Regulations under this paragraph do not apply to any contravention which occurred before the date on which they come into force. Appeal tribunal 11 In this Schedule  \u201c appeal tribunal \u201d has the same meaning as in Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Finance Act 1994. 6 In section 13A(2) of FA 1994 (meaning of  \u201crelevant decision\u201d), after paragraph (e) insert\u2014 ea any decision by  HMRC  that a person is liable to a penalty, or as to the amount of the person's liability, under\u2014 i regulations under section 88E of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979; or ii Schedule 2B to that Act; . 7 In Schedule 5 to that Act (decisions subject to review and appeal), in paragraph 3(1), after paragraph (o) insert\u2014 p any decision for the purposes of Part 6A (wholesaling of controlled liquor) as to whether or not, and in which respects, any person is to be, or to continue to be, approved and registered or as to the conditions or restrictions subject to which any person is approved and registered. . 8 Subject as follows, the amendments made by this section come into force on the day on which this Act is passed. 9 So far as relating to section 88C(1) of ALDA 1979, subsection (3) comes into force on 1 January 2016 (but see subsection (12) for the application of section 88C(1) in cases where an application has been made but not disposed of by that date). 10 So far as relating to section 88F of ALDA 1979, subsection (3) comes into force on such day as the Treasury may by regulations made by statutory instrument appoint. 11 An application for a person to be approved under section 88C of ALDA 1979 may not be made before 1 October 2015. 12 Where such an application made before 1 January 2016 has not been disposed of by that date, section 88C(1) of ALDA 1979 does not apply in relation to the person until the application is disposed of. 13 An application is  \u201cdisposed of\u201d when\u2014 a it is determined by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, b it is withdrawn, or c it is abandoned or otherwise ceases to have effect."}, {"act": "Finance Act 2015", "year": 2015, "section": "55", "section_title": "Rates of tobacco products duty", "section_text": "55 1 For the table in Schedule 1 to TPDA 1979 substitute\u2014 1.

This is subject to subsections (4) and (5). 4 An anti-forestalling notice may not restrict a person, during the controlled period, to removing for home use a total quantity of the tobacco products, or of the tobacco products of a particular description, that is less than 80% of\u2014 TPY 365 \u00d7 DCP where\u2014 TPY is the total quantity of the tobacco products, or (as the case may be) of the tobacco products of a particular description, removed for home use by the person in the period of 12 months ending with the third month before the month in which the controlled period begins, and DCP is the number of days in the controlled period. 5 An anti-forestalling notice may not restrict a person, in any month of the controlled period, to removing for home use less than 30% of the total quantity of the tobacco products, or of the tobacco products of a particular description, that could, under the anti-forestalling restrictions imposed by the notice, be removed for home use during the whole controlled period. 6 If, before the end of the controlled period, it appears to the Commissioners that the rate of duty\u2014 a will not be altered during the controlled period, but b may be altered within a month of the end of the controlled period, the Commissioners may publish an extension notice. 7 An extension notice may\u2014 a extend the controlled period by up to one month, and b in accordance with subsections (2) to (5), make such other modifications of the anti-forestalling notice as the Commissioners think appropriate in consequence of the extension. 8 The Commissioners may vary or revoke an anti-forestalling notice\u2014 a as it applies generally, or b if the Commissioners consider that exceptional circumstances justify doing so, in relation to a particular person. 9 This section does not affect the Commissioners' powers\u2014 a under section 128 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (restriction of delivery of goods), or b to make regulations under section 7 of this Act in relation to periods specified under that section of that Act. Anti-forestalling notices: sanctions 6B 1 This section applies if a person fails to comply with an anti-forestalling notice published under section 6A by, on one or more occasions, removing tobacco products for home use during the controlled period in contravention of an anti-forestalling restriction. 2 The failure to comply attracts a penalty under section 9 of the Finance Act 1994 (civil penalties) of an amount determined in accordance with subsection (3) (rather than that section). 3 The person is liable to a penalty of\u2014 a if the person has given an admission notice, 150% of the lost duty, and b otherwise, 200% of the lost duty. 4 An  \u201cadmission notice\u201d is a notice\u2014 a in which the person admits that the person\u2014 i has failed to comply with the anti-forestalling notice, and ii is liable to a penalty determined in accordance with subsection (3), and b that is in such form, and that provides such information, as the Commissioners may specify. 5 An admission notice cannot be given if, at any time in the period of 3 years ending with the day before the controlled period, the person has given an admission notice in relation to a failure to comply with another anti-forestalling notice. 6 An admission notice cannot be given\u2014 a at a time when the person has reason to believe that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs have discovered, or are about to discover, that the person has failed to comply with the anti-forestalling notice, or b after the end of the controlled period. 7 The  \u201clost duty\u201d is the amount (if any) by which the duty that would have been charged under section 2 on the excess tobacco products if they had, immediately after the end of the controlled period, been removed for home use exceeds the duty that was charged under that section on those tobacco products. 8 The  \u201cexcess tobacco products\u201d are the tobacco products mentioned in subsection (1) that the person removed, for home use, in contravention of an anti-forestalling restriction. 9 See section 6A for the meaning of  \u201canti-forestalling notice\u201d,  \u201canti-forestalling restriction\u201d and  \u201ccontrolled period\u201d."}, {"act": "Finance Act 2015", "year": 2015, "section": "57", "section_title": "Air passenger duty: exemption for children in standard class", "section_text": "57 1 In section 31 of FA 1994 (passengers: exceptions), after subsection (4) insert\u2014 4ZA A child who has not attained the age of 16 years is not a chargeable passenger in relation to a flight if the child's agreement for carriage\u2014 a is evidenced by a ticket, and b provides for standard class travel in relation to every flight on the child's journey. 4ZB Subsections (10) to (12) of section 30 (meaning of  \u201cstandard class travel\u201d) apply for the purposes of subsection (4ZA) as they apply for the purposes of that section. 2 The amendment made by this section has effect in relation to any carriage of a passenger which begins on or after 1 May 2015.

c make any other provision that is necessary in connection with paragraph (b) and subsection (8); d provide that a revocation by virtue of paragraph (b) may not be made after a specified date. 8 A special tax credit certification is to be treated as never having had effect in relation to any period with respect to which it is revoked by virtue of subsection (7)(b). 9 Regulations under this section which make provision such as is mentioned in subsection (7)(b) must require the Department to inform the Commissioners, and any other person to whom the Department has given a written notice of the certification, if the Department revokes a special tax credit certification. 10 Any expenses of the Department under or by virtue of this section or section 30B are to be appropriated from the Consolidated Fund of Northern Ireland by Act of the Northern Ireland Assembly. 11 In this section  \u201c the Department \u201d and  \u201c special tax credit \u201d have the same meaning as in section 30B. 3 In section 17 (meaning of  \u201c aggregate \u201d and  \u201c taxable aggregate \u201d), in subsection (6)(a), for  \u201cor 30A\u201d substitute  \u201c                    , 30A or 30B                  \u201d . 4 In section 48(1) (interpretation of Part), in the definition of  \u201ctax credit regulations\u201d, for  \u201cor 30A\u201d substitute  \u201c                    , 30A or 30B                  \u201d . 5 In paragraph 9A of Schedule 6 (incorrect records etc evidencing claim for tax credit), in sub-paragraph (1)(a)\u2014 a omit the  \u201cor\u201d at the end of sub-paragraph (i), and b after sub-paragraph (ii) insert , or                         iii section 30B(3) of this Act (special tax credit in Northern Ireland);
