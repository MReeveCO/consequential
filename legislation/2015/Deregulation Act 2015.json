and 215B do not have effect in relation to\u2014 a a claim under section 214 of this Act or section 21 of the Housing Act 1988 in respect of a tenancy which is settled before the commencement date (whether or not proceedings in relation to the claim have been instituted), or b proceedings under either of those sections in respect of a tenancy which have been finally determined before the commencement date. 3 Subsection (5) applies in respect of a tenancy if\u2014 a proceedings under section 214 in respect of the tenancy have been instituted before the commencement date but have not been settled or finally determined before that date, and b because of section 215A(4) or 215B(2), the court decides\u2014 i not to make an order under section 214(4) in respect of the tenancy, or ii to allow an appeal by the landlord against such an order. 4 Subsection (5) also applies in respect of a tenancy if\u2014 a proceedings for possession under section 21 of the Housing Act 1988 in respect of the tenancy have been instituted before the commencement date but have not been settled or finally determined before that date, and b because of section 215A(4) or 215B(2), the court decides\u2014 i to make an order for possession under that section in respect of the tenancy, or ii to allow an appeal by the landlord against a refusal to make such an order. 5 Where this subsection applies, the court must not order the tenant or any relevant person (as defined by section 213(10)) to pay the landlord's costs, to the extent that the court reasonably considers those costs are attributable to the proceedings under section 214 of this Act or (as the case may be) section 21 of the Housing Act 1988. 6 Proceedings have been  \u201c finally determined \u201d for the purposes of this section if \u2014 a they have been determined by a court, and b there is no further right to appeal against the determination. 7 There is no further right to appeal against a court determination if there is no right to appeal against the determination, or there is such a right but\u2014 a the time limit for making an appeal has expired without an appeal being brought, or b an appeal brought within that time limit has been withdrawn. 8 In this section  \u201c the commencement date \u201d means the date on which the Deregulation Act 2015 is passed."}, {"act": "Deregulation Act 2015",

warning must\u2014 a identify the section 46 requirement with which the person has failed to comply, b explain the nature of the failure to comply, c explain how the failure to comply has had, or is or was likely to have, the effect described in subsection (1)(b), d if the failure to comply is continuing, specify the period within which the requirement must be complied with and explain the consequences of the requirement not being complied with within that period, and e whether or not the failure to comply is continuing, explain the consequences of the person subsequently failing to

authority may require the person to whom the written warning was given to pay a fixed penalty to the authority if satisfied that the person has failed to comply with the section 46 requirement identified in the warning within the period specified by virtue of subsection (3)(d). 5 Where a person has been required to pay a fixed penalty under subsection (4) and that requirement has not been withdrawn on appeal, an authorised officer of the authority may require the person to pay a further fixed penalty to the authority if satisfied that the failure to comply is still continuing at the end of a relevant period which falls within the period of one year beginning with the day the written warning was given. 6 For the purposes of subsection (5)\u2014 a a  \u201crelevant period\u201d is

payments and is authorised in writing by the authority to perform that function; c any employee of such a person who is authorised in writing by the authority for the purpose of giving such warnings and requiring such payments. Amount of penalty under section 46A and recovery of penalty 46B 1 The amount of the monetary penalty that a person may be required to pay to a waste collection authority under section 46A is\u2014 a the amount specified by the waste collection authority in relation to the authority's area, or b if no amount is so specified, \u00a360. 2 A waste collection authority may make provision for treating a fixed penalty under section 46A as having been paid if a lesser amount is paid before the end of a period specified by the authority. 3 The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision in connection with the powers conferred on waste collection authorities in England under subsections (1)(a) and (2). 4 Regulations under subsection (3) may (in particular)\u2014 a require an amount specified under subsection (1)(a) to fall within a range prescribed in the regulations; b restrict the extent to which, and the circumstances in which, a waste collection authority may make provision under subsection (2). 5 The Secretary of State may by order substitute a different amount for the amount for the time being specified in subsection (1)(b). 6 A fixed penalty under section 46A\u2014 a is recoverable summarily as a civil debt; b is recoverable as if it were payable under an order of the High Court or the county court, if the court in question so orders.

Appeals against penalties under section 46A 46D 1 A person on whom a final notice is served under section 46C may appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against the decision to require payment of a fixed penalty. 2 On an appeal under this section the First-tier Tribunal may withdraw or confirm the requirement to pay the fixed penalty. 3 The requirement to pay the fixed penalty is suspended pending the determination or withdrawal of the appeal that is the final appeal made by the person against the decision to require payment of the penalty. (This is subject to subsection (4).) 4 Where the requirement to pay the fixed penalty is confirmed at any stage in the proceedings on appeal, payment must be made before the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the requirement is so confirmed unless the person makes a further appeal before the end of that period. 5 The reference in subsection (4) to the requirement to pay the fixed penalty being confirmed on appeal includes a reference to an appeal decision confirming the requirement to pay the fixed penalty being upheld on a further appeal. 4 In consequence of subsection (2), in section 47ZB(2)(b)\t\t\t\t\t(amount of fixed penalty for offence)\u2014 a omit sub-paragraph (i), and the  \u201cand\u201d following it;
