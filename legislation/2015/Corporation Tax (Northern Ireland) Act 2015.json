Step 2  Where an amount is apportioned under step 1 to a financial year in which the Northern Ireland rate is lower than the main rate, reduce that amount by multiplying it by the following fraction\u2014 NIR MR where\u2014 NIR is the Northern Ireland rate for the financial year; MR is the main rate for the financial year. Step 3  Add together each amount reduced under step 2 and each amount apportioned under step 1 but not reduced under step 2. 5 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a an amount of a loss is  \u201cmatched\u201d if relief in relation to the loss is given against Northern Ireland profits, and b an amount of a loss is  \u201cunmatched\u201d if relief in relation to the loss is given against profits that are not Northern Ireland profits. 6 In this section  \u201cthe loss\u201d and  \u201cthe profit period\u201d have the meanings given by section 357JC(1), 357JE(1) or 357JG(1) (as the case may be).

Application of 20% rule to collective investment schemes 357LG 1 This section applies if amounts arise or accrue to the company as a participant in a collective investment scheme. 2 It applies for the purpose of determining whether the requirements of the 20% rule are met in relation to a transaction carried out for the purposes of the scheme (so far as the transaction is one in respect of which amounts so arise or accrue). 3 In applying this section the following assumptions are to be made\u2014 a that all the transactions carried out for the purposes of the scheme are carried out on behalf of a company (\u201cthe assumed company\u201d) which is\u2014 i constituted for the purposes of the scheme, and ii not resident in the United Kingdom, and b that the participants do not have any rights in respect of the amounts arising or accruing in respect of those transactions, other than the rights which, if they held shares in the assumed company, would be their rights as shareholders. 4 If the scheme is such that the assumed company would not be regarded for tax purposes as carrying on a trade in the United Kingdom in relation to the accounting period in which the transaction was carried out, the requirements of the 20% rule are to be treated as met in relation to a transaction carried out for the purposes of the scheme. 5 If the scheme is such that the assumed company would be so regarded for tax purposes, sections 357LE and 357LF have effect in relation to a transaction carried out for the purposes of the scheme as if\u2014 a references to the company were references to the assumed company, and b references to the company's relevant disregarded income for a qualifying period were references to the sum of the amounts that would, for accounting periods comprised in the qualifying period, be chargeable to tax on the assumed company as profits deriving from the transactions\u2014 i carried out by the investment manager, and ii assumed to be carried out on behalf of the company. 6 In this section\u2014 \u201c collective investment scheme \u201d has the meaning given by section 235 of  FISMA  2000; \u201c participant \u201d, in relation to a collective investment scheme, is to be read in accordance with that section. Meaning of  \u201cinvestment manager\u201d and  \u201cinvestment transaction\u201d 357LH In this Chapter  \u201c investment manager \u201d and  \u201c investment transaction \u201d have the same meanings as in Chapter 2 of Part 24 (see section 1150(1)). Lloyd's agents Lloyd's agents 357LI 1 This section applies if a transaction is carried out on behalf of a company in the course of the company's trade by a person in Northern Ireland acting as a members' agent or managing agent at Lloyd's. 2 In relation to the transaction, the person is regarded for the purposes of section 357LA(1) as an agent of independent status acting in the ordinary course of the person's business if conditions A, B and C are met. 3 Condition A is that the company is a member of Lloyd's. 4 Condition B is that the transaction is carried out in the course of the company's underwriting business. 5 Condition C is that the person acting on behalf of the company in relation to the transaction acts as members' agent or as managing agent of the syndicate in question. 6 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a a company is a member of Lloyd's if it is a corporate member within the meaning of Chapter 5 of Part 4 of FA 1994; b \u201cmembers' agent\u201d and  \u201cmanaging agent\u201d are to be read in accordance with section 230 of that Act. Supplementary Investment managers: disregard of certain chargeable profits 357LJ 1 This section applies if\u2014 a an investment manager carries out one or more investment transactions on behalf of a company (whether or not the investment manager also carries out other transactions of any kind on behalf of the company), and b the investment manager falls to be treated as a NIRE of the company (whether because the independent investment manager conditions are not met in relation to such investment transactions or otherwise). 2 In determining under Chapter 7 of this Part the amount of profits attributable to the NIRE represented by the investment manager acting as an agent on behalf of the company, chargeable profits deriving from an investment transaction carried out by the investment manager on behalf of the company are to be disregarded in either of the following two cases\u2014 Case 1  The independent investment manager conditions are met in relation to the investment transaction. Case 2  The independent investment manager conditions, other than Condition D in section 357LD(6) (the 20% rule), are met in relation to the investment transaction. 3 But if case 2 applies in relation to the investment transaction, chargeable profits deriving from the transaction are to be disregarded only to the extent that they do not represent relevant disregarded income of the company to which the investment manager or a person connected with the investment manager has or has had any beneficial entitlement. 4 In subsection (3)  \u201crelevant disregarded income\u201d and  \u201cbeneficial entitlement\u201d have the meanings given in section 357LF. Miscellaneous 357LK 1 For the purposes of this Chapter a person is regarded as carrying out a transaction on behalf of another if the person\u2014 a undertakes the transaction, whether on behalf of or to the account of the other, or b gives instructions for it to be so carried out by another. 2 In the case of a person who acts as a broker or investment manager as part only of a business, this Chapter has effect as if that part were a separate business. CHAPTER 6 Northern Ireland profits and losses etc: SMEs Introductory 357M 1 This Chapter applies to a company that is a Northern Ireland company in an accounting period by virtue of the SME condition in section 357KA. 2 In this Chapter\u2014 a a reference to  \u201cthe company\u201d or  \u201cthe accounting period\u201d is to the company or accounting period mentioned in subsection (1); b a reference to  \u201cthe trade\u201d is to any qualifying trade carried on by the company in the period. 3 Section 357MA contains provision under which profits or losses of the trade for the accounting period are\u2014 a Northern Ireland profits or losses of the trade, b mainstream profits or losses of the trade, or c a combination of\u2014 i profits or losses within paragraph (a), and ii profits or losses within paragraph (b). 4 Further provision under which profits or losses of the trade may be Northern Ireland profits or losses of the trade, or mainstream profits or losses of the trade, is contained in\u2014 a Chapters 8 to 15 of this Part, and b CAA  2001 (see section 6E of that Act). 5 This Chapter has effect for the purposes of this Part. Northern Ireland profits or losses and mainstream profits or losses 357MA 1 Where the trade is a qualifying trade by virtue of section 357KB(1) (trade other than excluded trade), the profits or losses of the trade for the accounting period are Northern Ireland profits or Northern Ireland losses of the trade for the period to the extent that they do not arise from an excluded activity. 2 Subsection (1)\u2014 a does not apply in relation to any profits or losses of the trade that form part of the Northern Ireland profits or losses of the trade by virtue of any provision apart from this section, and b is subject to any provision apart from this section under which profits or losses of the trade are mainstream profits or losses of the trade. 3 Where the trade is a qualifying trade by virtue of section 357KB(2) (excluded trade with back-office activities), the profits, if any, determined under section 357MB as back-office profits of the trade for the accounting period are Northern Ireland profits of the trade for the period. 4 The profits or losses of the trade for the accounting period are mainstream profits or mainstream losses of the trade for the period to the extent that they are not Northern Ireland profits or Northern Ireland losses by virtue of subsection (1) or (3) or any provision apart from this section. 5 Subsection (4) does not apply in relation to any profits or losses of the trade that form part of the mainstream profits or losses of the trade by virtue of any provision apart from this section. Profit imputed to back-office activities 357MB 1 To determine for the purposes of section 357MA(3) the back-office profits of the qualifying trade for the accounting period, take the following steps\u2014 Step 1  Multiply each back-office deduction by the relevant percentage. Step 2  Add together each amount calculated under step 1. 2 In subsection (1)\u2014 \u201c back-office deduction \u201d means a deduction\u2014 to which the company is entitled in calculating the profits of the trade for the period, and which is in respect of back-office activities; \u201c the relevant percentage \u201d means 5%. 3 The Treasury may by regulations amend subsection (2) so as to substitute a different percentage for the percentage for the time being specified there. 4 Regulations under this section\u2014 a may make different provision for different purposes (including, in particular, different trades or different back-office activities); b may make incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision and savings. CHAPTER 7 Northern Ireland profits and losses etc: large companies Introductory Introductory 357N 1 This Chapter applies to a company that is a Northern Ireland company in an accounting period by virtue of the large company condition in section 357KA. 2 In this Chapter\u2014 a a reference to  \u201cthe company\u201d or  \u201cthe accounting period\u201d is to the company or accounting period mentioned in subsection (1); b a reference to  \u201cthe trade\u201d is to any qualifying trade carried on by the company in the period. 3 Section 357NA contains provision under which profits or losses of the trade for the accounting period are\u2014 a Northern Ireland profits or losses of the trade, b mainstream profits or losses of the trade, or c a combination of\u2014 i profits or losses within paragraph (a), and ii profits or losses within paragraph (b). 4 Further provision under which profits or losses of the trade may be Northern Ireland profits or losses of the trade, or mainstream profits or losses of the trade, is contained in\u2014 a Chapters 8 to 15 of this Part, and b CAA 2001 (see section 6E of that Act). 5 This Chapter has effect for the purposes of this Part. Northern Ireland profits or losses and mainstream profits or losses Northern Ireland profits or losses and mainstream profits or losses 357NA 1 Where the trade is a qualifying trade by virtue of section 357KB(1) (trade other than excluded trade), the profits or losses of the trade for the accounting period are Northern Ireland profits or Northern Ireland losses of the trade for the period to the extent that they\u2014 a do not arise from an excluded activity, b arise directly or indirectly through or from the company's NIRE, or from property or rights used by, or held by, or for, the company's NIRE, and c are attributable to the company's NIRE. 2 Subsection (1)\u2014 a does not apply in relation to any profits or losses of the trade that form part of the Northern Ireland profits or losses of the trade by virtue of any provision apart from this section, and b is subject to any provision apart from this section under which profits or losses of the trade are mainstream profits or losses of the trade. 3 Where the trade is a qualifying trade by virtue of section 357KB(2) (excluded trade with back-office activities), the profits, if any, determined under section 357NB as Northern Ireland back-office profits of the trade for the accounting period are Northern Ireland profits of the trade for the period. 4 The profits or losses of the trade for the accounting period are mainstream profits or mainstream losses of the trade for the period to the extent that they are not Northern Ireland profits or Northern Ireland losses by virtue of subsection (1) or (3) or any provision apart from this section. 5 Subsection (4) does not apply in relation to any profits or losses of the trade that form part of the mainstream profits or losses of the trade by virtue of any provision apart from this section. 6 Sections 357NC to 357NI contain provision for determining the amount of profits or losses of a trade that are attributable to the company's NIRE. 7 See also section 357LJ (investment managers: disregard of certain chargeable profits), which provides for profits of certain investment transactions to be disregarded in determining the amount of profits attributable to a NIRE. Profit imputed to Northern Ireland back-office activities 357NB 1 To determine for the purposes of section 357NA(3) the Northern Ireland back-office profits of the trade for the accounting period, take the following steps\u2014 Step 1  Multiply each Northern Ireland back-office deduction by the relevant percentage. Step 2  Add together each amount calculated under step 1. 2 In subsection (1)\u2014 \u201c Northern Ireland back-office deduction \u201d means a deduction\u2014 to which the company is entitled in calculating the profits of the trade for the period, and which is in respect of back-office activities carried on in Northern Ireland; \u201c the relevant percentage \u201d means 5%. 3 The Treasury may by regulations amend subsection (2) so as to substitute a different percentage for the percentage for the time being specified there. 4 Regulations under this section\u2014 a may make different provision for different purposes (including, in particular, different trades or different back-office activities); b may make incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision and savings. The separate enterprise principle The separate enterprise principle 357NC 1 The profits of the company that are attributable to its NIRE are those that the NIRE would have made if it were a distinct and separate enterprise which\u2014 a engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, and b dealt wholly independently with the company. 2 In applying subsection (1) it is to be assumed that\u2014 a the NIRE has the same credit rating as the company, and b the NIRE has such equity and loan capital as it could reasonably be expected to have in the circumstances specified in that subsection. 3 In this Chapter the principle in subsection (1) (read with subsection (2)) is called  \u201cthe separate enterprise principle\u201d. Transactions treated as being on arm's length terms 357ND In accordance with the separate enterprise principle, transactions between the company's NIRE and any other part of the company are treated as taking place on such terms as would have been agreed between parties dealing at arm's length. Provision of goods or services for NIRE 357NE 1 This section applies if the company provides its NIRE with goods or services. 2 If the goods or services are of a kind that the company supplies, in the ordinary course of business, to third parties dealing with it at arm's length, the matter is dealt with as a transaction to which the separate enterprise principle applies. 3 If not, the matter is dealt with as an expense incurred by the company for the purposes of its NIRE (see section 357NF). Rules about deductions and receipts Allowable deductions 357NF 1 A deduction is allowed in calculating the profits attributable to the company's NIRE for any allowable expenses incurred for the purposes of the NIRE. 2 Expenses incurred for the purposes of the NIRE include executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in Northern Ireland or elsewhere. 3 It does not matter whether the expenses are incurred by, or reimbursed by, the NIRE. 4 The amount of expenses to be taken into account under subsection (1) is the actual cost to the company. 5 \u201cAllowable expenses\u201d, means expenses of a kind in respect of which a deduction is allowed for corporation tax purposes or (in the case of a company that is not UK-resident) would be so allowed if incurred by a  UK  resident company. Deductions attributable to the NIRE for costs 357NG A deduction is allowed in calculating the profits attributable to the company's NIRE for any costs that would have been incurred on the assumptions in section 357NC(2). Payments and receipts in respect of intangible assets 357NH 1 No deduction is allowed in calculating the profits attributable to the company's NIRE for royalties paid, or other similar payments made, by the NIRE to any other part of the company in respect of the use of intangible assets held by the company. 2 But a deduction is allowed in calculating the profits attributable to the NIRE for any contribution by the NIRE to the costs of creation of an intangible asset. 3 No receipt is to be brought into account in calculating the profits attributable to the NIRE for royalties or other similar amounts received from any other part of the company in respect of the use of intangible assets held by the company for the purposes of the NIRE. 4 But a receipt is to be brought into account in calculating profits attributable to the NIRE for any contribution received by the NIRE in respect of the costs of creation of an intangible asset. 5 In this section  \u201cintangible asset\u201d\u2014 a includes any intellectual property (as defined in section 712(3) of CTA 2009), and b subject to that, has the meaning it has for accounting purposes. Interest or other financing costs and receipts 357NI 1 No deduction is allowed in calculating the profits attributable to the company's NIRE for payments of interest or other financing costs by the NIRE to any other part of the company. 2 No receipt is to be brought into account in calculating profits attributable to the NIRE for interest or other financing income received from any other part of the company. Supplementary Losses 357NJ This Part applies in relation to the attribution of losses to a company's NIRE as it applies to the attribution of profits. Trade includes office 357NK In this Part, except so far as the context otherwise requires\u2014 a references to a trade include an office, and b references to carrying on a trade including holding an office. CHAPTER 8 Intangible fixed assets Introductory Introductory 357O 1 This Chapter makes provision about amounts which are treated by section 747 of CTA 2009 (intangible fixed assets held for purposes of trade) as receipts or expenses of a trade carried on by a Northern Ireland company. 2 In this Chapter  \u201c intangible fixed asset \u201d has the same meaning as in Part 8 of CTA 2009 (see section 713 of that Act). Calculating Northern Ireland profits or Northern Ireland losses Rules affecting calculation of Northern Ireland profits or losses 357OA 1 If a company is a Northern Ireland company in an accounting period, this section applies to the debits and credits that are given effect under section 747 of CTA 2009 (intangible fixed assets held for purposes of trade) as receipts or expenses of the company's trade in calculating the profits of the trade. 2 The Northern Ireland intangibles credits and Northern Ireland intangibles debits form part of the Northern Ireland profits or Northern Ireland losses of the trade. 3 Any other credits or debits to which this section applies form part of the mainstream profits or mainstream losses of the trade. 4 For the meaning of  \u201cNorthern Ireland intangibles credits\u201d, see section 357OB(2)(a) and (3) and 357OC(2). 5 For the meaning of  \u201cNorthern Ireland intangibles debits\u201d, see section 357OB(2)(b) and (4) and 357OC(3). Northern Ireland intangibles credits and Northern Ireland intangibles debits Northern Ireland intangibles credits and debits: SMEs 357OB 1 This section applies to a company that\u2014 a is a Northern Ireland company in an accounting period by virtue of the SME condition in section 357KA, and b carries on a trade which is a qualifying trade by virtue of section 357KB(1) (trade other than excluded trade). 2 If the company does not carry on an excluded activity\u2014 a the Northern Ireland intangibles credits for the accounting period are\u2014 i the credits treated by section 747(2) of CTA 2009 as receipts of the qualifying trade for the period, except credits in respect of pre-commencement assets and realisation credits, and ii the Northern Ireland element of each realisation credit for the period, and b the Northern Ireland intangibles debits for the accounting period are\u2014 i the debits treated by section 747(3) of CTA 2009 as expenses of the qualifying trade for the period, except debits in respect of pre-commencement assets and realisation debits, and ii the Northern Ireland element of each realisation debit for the period. 3 If the company carries on an excluded activity, the Northern Ireland intangibles credits for the accounting period are\u2014 a the credits treated by section 747(2) of CTA 2009 as receipts of the qualifying trade for the period, to the extent that\u2014 i they are neither credits in respect of pre-commencement assets nor realisation credits, and ii they are not attributable to assets held for the purposes of the excluded activity, and b the Northern Ireland element of each realisation credit for the period. 4 If the company carries on an excluded activity, the Northern Ireland intangibles debits for the accounting period are\u2014 a the debits treated by section 747(3) of CTA 2009 as expenses of the qualifying trade for the period, to the extent that\u2014 i they are neither debits in respect of pre-commencement assets nor realisation debits, and ii they are not attributable to assets held for the purposes of the excluded activity, and b the Northern Ireland element of each realisation debit for the period. 5 For the meaning of  \u201cpre-commencement asset\u201d, see section 357OH. 6 For the meaning of a  \u201crealisation credit\u201d and  \u201crealisation debit\u201d and of the  \u201cNorthern Ireland element\u201d of either, see sections 357OD and 357OE. Northern Ireland intangibles credits and debits: large companies 357OC 1 This section applies to a company that is a Northern Ireland company in an accounting period by virtue of the large company condition in section 357KA. 2 The Northern Ireland intangibles credits for the accounting period are\u2014 a the credits treated by section 747(2) of CTA 2009 as receipts of the qualifying trade for the period, to the extent that\u2014 i they are neither credits in respect of pre-commencement assets nor realisation credits, ii they are not attributable to assets held for the purposes of an excluded activity, and iii they would in accordance with the separate enterprise principle in section 357NC be attributed to the company's NIRE, and b the Northern Ireland element of each realisation credit for the period. 3 The Northern Ireland intangibles debits for the accounting period are\u2014 a the debits treated by section 747(3) of CTA 2009 as expenses of the qualifying trade for the period, to the extent that\u2014 i they are neither debits in respect of pre-commencement assets nor realisation debits, ii they are not attributable to assets held for the purposes of an excluded activity, and iii they would in accordance with the separate enterprise principle in section 357NC be attributed to the company's NIRE, and b the Northern Ireland element of each realisation debit for the period. 4 For the meaning of  \u201cpre-commencement asset\u201d, see section 357OH. 5 For the meaning of a  \u201crealisation credit\u201d and  \u201crealisation debit\u201d and of the  \u201cNorthern Ireland element\u201d of either, see sections 357OD and 357OE. Realisation credits and realisation debits \u201cRealisation credit\u201d and  \u201crealisation debit\u201d 357OD In this Chapter, a  \u201crealisation credit\u201d or  \u201c realisation debit \u201d, in relation to a trade carried on by a company in an accounting period, means a credit or debit which\u2014 a is brought into account by the company under Part 8 of CTA 2009 for the period as a result of Chapter 4 of that Part (realisation of intangible fixed assets), b is treated under section 747 of that Act as a receipt or expense of the trade, and c does not relate to a pre-commencement asset. The Northern Ireland element of a realisation credit or debit 357OE 1 This section has effect for the purposes of this Chapter. 2 A realisation credit or realisation debit can have a  \u201cNorthern Ireland element\u201d only if\u2014 a the intangible fixed asset to which it relates has been held by the company, in an accounting period in which it was a Northern Ireland company, wholly or partly for the purposes of a qualifying trade carried on by the company, except so far as the trade consists of an excluded activity, or b in the case of a realisation credit, roll-over relief was previously given in respect of an asset which was so held. 3 The  \u201cNorthern Ireland element\u201d of a realisation credit or realisation debit is determined in accordance with section 357OF or 357OG. 4 \u201c Roll-over relief \u201d means relief under Chapter 7 of Part 8 of CTA 2009 (roll-over relief in case of realisation and reinvestment). Northern Ireland element: general rule 357OF 1 If a realisation credit or realisation debit arises under section 735 of CTA 2009 (asset written down for tax purposes), its Northern Ireland element is determined by the formula\u2014 A \u00d7 NI C \u2212 TWDV where\u2014 A is the amount of the realisation credit or realisation debit; NI is the total net Northern Ireland debits (see subsection (2)); C is the cost of the asset recognised for tax purposes, as defined by section 742(2) or 743(2) of CTA 2009; TWDV is the tax written-down value of the asset within the meaning of Part 8 of CTA 2009 (see Chapter 5 of that Part). 2 In subsection (1)  \u201c the total net Northern Ireland debits \u201d means\u2014 a in a case within section 742 of CTA 2009, the total debits previously brought into account for tax purposes under Part 8 of CTA 2009 in respect of the asset so far as they were Northern Ireland intangibles debits for the purposes of this Chapter, less the total credits previously so brought into account for tax purposes so far as they were Northern Ireland intangibles credits for the purposes of this Chapter, or b in a case within section 743 of CTA 2009, the total debits previously brought into account for tax purposes under Part 8 of CTA 2009 in respect of the asset so far as they were Northern Ireland intangibles debits for the purposes of this Chapter. 3 Subsection (4) applies if\u2014 a a realisation credit or realisation debit arises under section 736 of CTA 2009 (asset shown in balance sheet and not written down for tax purposes), or b a realisation credit arises under section 738 of CTA 2009 (asset not shown in balance sheet). 4 The Northern Ireland element of the realisation credit or realisation debit is such proportion of the realisation credit or realisation debit as can on a just and reasonable basis be attributed to the holding of the asset for the purposes of the relevant Northern Ireland trade. 5 This section does not apply to a realisation credit if section 357OG (cases involving roll-over relief) applies. 6 In this section  \u201c the relevant Northern Ireland trade \u201d means the qualifying trade carried on by the company in an accounting period in which it was a Northern Ireland company, except so far as the trade consists of an excluded activity. Northern Ireland element: credits where roll-over relief involved 357OG 1 This section applies if a realisation credit relates to an asset (\u201cthe new asset\u201d) whose cost recognised for tax purposes is reduced as a result of roll-over relief previously given on the realisation of another asset (\u201cthe old asset\u201d). 2 To calculate the Northern Ireland element of the realisation credit on the realisation of the new asset, take the following steps\u2014 Step 1  Calculate the part (if any) of the realisation credit that is attributable to the total net debits in respect of the new asset. Step 2  Calculate the Northern Ireland element of the result of Step 1 by applying to it the proportion that the total net Northern Ireland debits bears to the total net debits. Step 3  If the realisation credit exceeds the total net debits, calculate any part of the excess that is attributable to the reduction in the cost of the new asset recognised for tax purposes that resulted from the roll-over relief. Step 4  If, in the absence of roll-over relief, a proportion of the realisation credit on the realisation of the old asset would in accordance with section 357OF have been a Northern Ireland element, calculate the Northern Ireland element of the result of Step 3 by applying that proportion to it. Step 5  If any remaining amount of the realisation credit has not been attributed under Step 1 or 3, calculate the Northern Ireland element of that remaining amount by determining how much of that remaining amount can on a just and reasonable basis be attributed to the holding of the new asset for the purposes of the relevant Northern Ireland trade. 3 The Northern Ireland element of the realisation credit is the total of the Northern Ireland elements calculated at Steps 2, 4 and 5. 4 In this section\u2014 \u201c the relevant Northern Ireland trade \u201d means the qualifying trade carried on by the company in an accounting period in which it was a Northern Ireland company, except so far as the trade consists of an excluded activity; \u201c the total net debits \u201d means\u2014 in a case within section 742 of CTA 2009, the total debits previously brought into account for tax purposes under Part 8 of CTA 2009 in respect of the asset, less the total credits previously so brought into account (if any), or in a case within section 743 of CTA 2009, the total debits previously brought into account for tax purposes under Part 8 of CTA 2009 in respect of the asset; \u201c the total net Northern Ireland debits \u201d has the meaning given by section 357OF(2). Pre-commencement assets Pre-commencement asset 357OH 1 An intangible fixed asset is a  \u201cpre-commencement asset\u201d if it was created before the commencement day. 2 \u201c The commencement day \u201d has the meaning given by section 5(4) of the Corporation Tax (Northern Ireland) Act 2015. 3 Subsections (1) and (2) have effect for the purposes of this Chapter. 4 The general rule is that intangible fixed assets are treated for the purposes of subsection (1) as having been created before the commencement day if they were held (by the company or another person) at any time before that day. 5 The general rule is subject to the following provisions\u2014 a section 357OI (goodwill); b section 357OJ (assets representing production expenditure on films). Goodwill 357OI For the purposes of section 357OH(1) (pre-commencement asset), goodwill is treated as created\u2014 a before the commencement day in a case in which the business in question was carried on by the company or any other person at any time before that day, and b on or after the commencement day in any other case. Assets representing production expenditure on films 357OJ 1 In determining for the purposes of section 357OH(1) (pre-commencement asset) whether an asset representing production expenditure on a film was created before the commencement day or on or after that day, the asset is treated as created when the film is completed. 2 In this section\u2014 a \u201c completed \u201d has the same meaning as in Part 15 of CTA 2009 (see section 1181(5) of that Act), b \u201c film \u201d has the same meaning as in that Part (see section 1181 of that Act), and c \u201c production expenditure \u201d has the same meaning as in that Part (see section 1184 of that Act). Fungible assets 357OK 1 This section and section 357OL have effect for the purposes of this Chapter in relation to assets to which section 858 of CTA 2009 (treatment of fungible assets) applies. 2 Section 858 of CTA 2009 applies as if\u2014 a pre-commencement assets, and b intangible fixed assets that are not pre-commencement assets, were assets of different kinds. 3 If section 858 of CTA 2009 applies (whether or not it is a case where subsection (2) has effect)\u2014 a a single asset comprising pre-commencement assets is treated as itself being a pre-commencement asset, and b a single asset comprising intangible fixed assets that are not pre-commencement assets is treated as itself being an asset which is not a pre-commencement asset. Realisation and acquisition of fungible assets 357OL 1 Subsection (2) applies if\u2014 a a company realises a fungible asset, and b apart from section 357OK(2), the asset would be treated as part of a single asset comprising both pre-commencement assets and assets that are not pre-commencement assets. 2 The realisation is treated as diminishing the single asset of the company comprising pre-commencement assets in priority to diminishing the single asset of the company comprising assets that are not pre-commencement assets. 3 Fungible assets acquired by a company that would not otherwise be treated as pre-commencement assets are so treated so far as they are identified, in accordance with the following rules, with pre-commencement assets realised by the company. 4 Rule 1 is that assets acquired are identified with pre-commencement assets of the same kind realised by the company within the period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the date of the acquisition. 5 The reference in subsection (4) to assets  \u201cof the same kind\u201d is to assets that are, or but for section 357OK(2) would be, treated as part of a single asset because of section 858 of CTA 2009. 6 Rule 2 is that assets realised earlier are identified before assets realised later. 7 Rule 3 is that assets acquired earlier are identified before assets acquired later. 8 In this section\u2014 \u201c fungible asset \u201d means an intangible fixed asset to which section 858 of CTA 2009 applies; \u201c realisation \u201d, in relation to a fungible asset, has the same meaning as in Part 8 of CTA 2009 (see sections 734 and 856 of that Act). Assets treated as pre-commencement assets Assets whose value derives from pre-commencement assets 357OM 1 This section applies if\u2014 a on or after the commencement day a company (\u201c the acquiring company \u201d) acquires an intangible fixed asset (\u201cthe acquired asset\u201d) from a person (\u201c the transferor \u201d), b the acquired asset is created on or after the commencement day, c the value of the acquired asset derives in whole or in part from any other asset (\u201cthe other asset\u201d), and d the other asset meets the pre-commencement status conditions. 2 In the hands of the acquiring company the acquired asset is treated for the purposes of this Chapter as a pre-commencement asset so far as its value derives from the other asset. 3 If only part of the value of the acquired asset derives from the other asset, this Chapter has effect as if there were separate assets representing the part that does so derive and the part that does not so derive. 4 For the purposes of this section the cases in which the value of an asset may be derived from any other asset include any case where\u2014 a assets have been merged or divided, b assets have changed their nature, or c rights or interests in or over assets have been created or extinguished. 5 Section 357ON supplements this section. The pre-commencement status conditions 357ON 1 For the purposes of section 357OM(1) the other asset meets the pre-commencement status conditions if\u2014 a it was created before the commencement day, or b on or after the commencement day the other asset has been a pre-commencement asset in the hands of the transferor or any other person. 2 Any apportionment necessary for the purposes of section 357OM(3) must be made on a just and reasonable basis. 3 Sections 357OH(4), 357OI and 357OJ (provisions explaining when assets are treated as created) apply for the purposes of section 357OM as they apply for the purposes of section 357OH(1). 4 Expressions used in this section have the same meaning as in section 357OM. Assets acquired in connection with disposals of pre-commencement assets 357OO 1 This section applies if\u2014 a a person disposes of an asset which\u2014 i in the case of an intangible fixed asset, is a pre-commencement asset, or ii in the case of any other asset, was created before the commencement day, and b a company acquires an intangible fixed asset directly or indirectly in consequence of the disposal or otherwise in connection with it. 2 The acquired asset is treated for the purposes of this Chapter as a pre-commencement asset in the company's hands. 3 For the purposes of this section a person  \u201cdisposes of\u201d an asset if\u2014 a for the purposes of  TCGA  1992, the person makes a part disposal of the asset or any other disposal of it, b in the case of an intangible fixed asset, there is for the purposes of Part 8 of CTA 2009 a realisation of the asset, or c the person grants a licence in respect of the asset. 4 For the purposes of this section it does not matter whether\u2014 a the asset that the person disposes of is the same asset as the acquired asset, b the acquired asset is acquired at the time of the disposal, or c the acquired asset is acquired by merging assets or otherwise. Interpretation Interpretation of Chapter 357OP In this Chapter\u2014 \u201c the commencement day \u201d has the meaning given by section 357OH(2); \u201c the Northern Ireland element \u201d, in relation to a realisation credit or realisation debit, is to be read in accordance with section 357OE; \u201c Northern Ireland intangibles credits \u201d means credits brought into account under Part 8 of CTA 2009 that are in accordance with section 357OB(2)(a) or (3) or section 357OC(2) Northern Ireland intangibles credits; \u201c Northern Ireland intangibles debits \u201d means debits brought into account under Part 8 of CTA 2009 that are in accordance with section 357OB(2)(b) or (4) or section 357OC(3) Northern Ireland intangibles debits; \u201c pre-commencement asset \u201d has the meaning given by section 357OH; \u201crealisation credit\u201d and  \u201crealisation debit\u201d are to be read in accordance with section 357OD; \u201c roll-over relief \u201d has the meaning given by section 357OE.

CHAPTER 11 Film tax relief Introductory Introduction and interpretation 357R 1 This Chapter makes provision about the operation of Part 15 of CTA 2009 (film tax relief) in relation to expenditure incurred by a company in an accounting period in which it is a Northern Ireland company. 2 In this Chapter\u2014 a \u201c Northern Ireland expenditure \u201d means expenditure incurred in a trade to the extent that the expenditure forms part of the Northern Ireland profits or Northern Ireland losses of the trade; b \u201c the separate film trade \u201d has the same meaning as in Chapter 3 of Part 15 of CTA 2009 (see section 1195(5) of that Act); c \u201c qualifying expenditure \u201d has the same meaning as in that Chapter (see section 1199(3) of that Act). 3 References in Part 15 of CTA 2009 to  \u201cfilm tax relief\u201d include relief under this Chapter. Film tax relief Northern Ireland additional deduction 357RA 1 In this Chapter  \u201c a Northern Ireland additional deduction \u201d means so much of a deduction under section 1199 of CTA 2009 (additional deduction for qualifying expenditure) as is calculated by reference to qualifying expenditure that is Northern Ireland expenditure. 2 A Northern Ireland additional deduction forms part of the Northern Ireland profits or Northern Ireland losses of the separate film trade. Northern Ireland supplementary deduction 357RB 1 This section applies where\u2014 a a company is entitled under section 1199 of CTA 2009 to an additional deduction in calculating the profit or loss of the separate film trade in an accounting period, b the company is a Northern Ireland company in the period, c the additional deduction is wholly or partly a Northern Ireland additional deduction, and d any of the following conditions is met\u2014 i the company does not have a surrenderable loss in the accounting period; ii the company has a surrenderable loss in the accounting period, but does not make a claim under section 1201 of CTA 2009 (film tax credit claimable if company has surrenderable loss) for the period; iii the company has a surrenderable loss in the accounting period and makes a claim under that section for the period, but the amount of Northern Ireland losses surrendered on the claim is less than the Northern Ireland additional deduction. 2 The company is entitled to make another deduction (\u201ca Northern Ireland supplementary deduction\u201d) in respect of qualifying expenditure. 3 See section 357RC for provision about the amount of the Northern Ireland supplementary deduction. 4 The Northern Ireland supplementary deduction\u2014 a is made in calculating the profit or loss of the separate film trade, and b forms part of the Northern Ireland profits or Northern Ireland losses of the separate film trade. 5 In this section  \u201c surrenderable loss \u201d has the meaning given by section 1201 of CTA 2009. Northern Ireland supplementary deduction: amount 357RC 1 This section contains provision for the purposes of section 357RB(2) about the amount of the Northern Ireland supplementary deduction. 2 If the accounting period falls within only one financial year, the amount of the Northern Ireland supplementary deduction is\u2014 ( A \u2212 B ) \u00d7 MR \u2212 NIR NIR where\u2014 A is the amount of the Northern Ireland additional deduction brought into account in the accounting period; B is the amount of Northern Ireland losses surrendered in any claim under section 1201 of CTA 2009 for the accounting period; MR is the main rate for the financial year; NIR is the Northern Ireland rate for the financial year. 3 If the accounting period falls within more than one financial year, the amount of the Northern Ireland supplementary deduction is determined by taking the following steps.

Relevant Northern Ireland IP profits: large companies 357VC 1 This section applies if\u2014 a the company is a Northern Ireland company in the relevant period by virtue of the large company condition in section 357KA, and b the trade is a qualifying trade by virtue of section 357KB(1) (trade other than excluded trade). 2 The company has  \u201crelevant Northern Ireland IP profits\u201d for the period only if IP-related profits that (in accordance with Chapters 6 to 8) form part of its Northern Ireland profits or Northern Ireland losses for the period amount to Northern Ireland profits (rather than losses). 3 The company's  \u201crelevant Northern Ireland profits\u201d for the period are the appropriate proportion of the relevant IP profits. 4 The  \u201cappropriate proportion\u201d is\u2014 NI P where\u2014 NI is so much of the IP-related profits as (in accordance with Chapters 6 to 8) forms part of its Northern Ireland profits; P is the IP-related profits. 5 In this section the  \u201c IP-related profits \u201d means the profits of the company's trade for the accounting period attributable to\u2014 a qualifying IP rights held by the company, or b exclusive licences held by the company in respect of qualifying IP rights. Relevant  IP  losses Relevant IP losses 357VD 1 If any of the set-off provisions prevents section 357A from applying to an amount of relevant IP profits of the trade of the company for the relevant period, sections 357VA to 357VC have effect as if references to the relevant IP profits of the trade were references to the relevant IP profits reduced by that amount. 2 The  \u201cset-off provisions\u201d are\u2014 a subsection (3) of section 357EA (effect of set-off amount on company with more than one trade), b subsection (4) of section 357EB (allocation of set-off amount within a group), and c subsection (3) of section 357EC (carry-forward of set-off amount). Interpretation Interpretation of Chapter 357VE In this Chapter\u2014 \u201c exclusive licence \u201d, in relation to a right, has the same meaning as in Part 8A (see section 357BA); \u201c qualifying IP right \u201d has the same meaning as in Part 8A (see section 357B(4)); \u201c relevant IP profits \u201d, in relation to the trade of a company, is to be read in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 8A (but subject to section 357VD); \u201c relevant period \u201d has the meaning given by section 357V.
