adjusted allowance, the amount of brought-forward allowance included in the person's allowance on death is calculated as follows.  Step 1  Express the person's brought-forward allowance as a percentage of the person's default allowance.  Step 2  Multiply\u2014 E \u2212 T T 2 by the percentage given by step 1.  Step 3  Reduce the person's brought-forward allowance by the amount given by step 2.

Step 1  Express the value of the person's qualifying former residential interest as a percentage of the person's former allowance, but take that percentage to be 100% if it would otherwise be higher.  Step 2  Express QRI as a percentage of the person's allowance on death, where QRI is so much of   the value transferred by the transfer of value under section 4 on the person\u2019s death  as is attributable to the person's qualifying residential interest, but take that percentage to be 100% if it would otherwise be higher.
