Objectives of the Financial Policy Committee 9C 1 The Financial Policy Committee is to exercise its functions with a view to\u2014 a contributing to the achievement by the Bank of the Financial Stability Objective, and b subject to that, supporting the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment. 2 The responsibility of the Committee in relation to the achievement by the Bank of the Financial Stability Objective relates primarily to the identification of, monitoring of, and taking of action to remove or reduce, systemic risks with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the  UK  financial system. 3 Those systemic risks include, in particular\u2014 a systemic risks attributable to structural features of financial markets, such as connections between financial institutions, b systemic risks attributable to the distribution of risk within the financial sector, and c unsustainable levels of leverage, debt or credit growth. 4 Subsections (1)(a) and (2) do not require or authorise the Committee to exercise its functions in a way that would in its opinion be likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the UK economy in the medium or long term. 5 In this Part  \u201c systemic risk \u201d means a risk to the stability of the UK financial system as a whole or of a significant part of that system. 6 For the purposes of subsection (5) it is immaterial whether the risk arises in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. 7 In subsection (3)(c)\u2014 \u201c credit growth \u201d means the growth in lending by the financial sector to individuals in the United Kingdom and businesses carried on in the United Kingdom; \u201c debt \u201d means debt owed to the financial sector by individuals in the United Kingdom and businesses carried on in the United Kingdom; \u201c leverage \u201d means the leverage of the financial sector in the United Kingdom. Specification of matters relevant to economic policy 9D 1 The Treasury may by notice in writing to the Financial Policy Committee specify for the purposes of section 9C(1)(b) what the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government is to be taken to be. 2 The Treasury must specify under subsection (1) the matter mentioned there\u2014 a before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which section 9C comes into force, and b at least once in every calendar year following that in which the first notice under that subsection is given. 3 Where the Treasury give notice under this section they must\u2014 a publish the notice in such manner as they think fit, and b lay a copy of it before Parliament. Recommendations by Treasury 9E 1 The Treasury may at any time by notice in writing to the Financial Policy Committee make recommendations to the Committee about\u2014 a matters that the Committee should regard as relevant to the Committee's understanding of the Bank's Financial Stability Objective; b the responsibility of the Committee in relation to the achievement of that objective; c the responsibility of the Committee in relation to support for the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment; d matters to which the Committee should have regard in exercising its functions. 2 The Treasury must make recommendations under subsection (1)(a) or (b) (\u201crecommendations about the objective\u201d)\u2014 a before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which this section comes into force, and b at least once in every calendar year following that in which the first recommendations about the objective are made. 3 The Committee must respond to any recommendations made to it under subsection (1) by notifying the Treasury, in relation to each recommendation, of one or more of the following\u2014 a action that the Committee has taken in accordance with the recommendation; b if or to the extent that the recommendation does not relate to immediate action, the Committee's intention to act in accordance with it; c whether or not the recommendation relates to immediate action, the Committee's reasons for not intending to act in accordance with it. 4 Notification under subsection (3) must be given or confirmed in writing. 5 The Treasury must\u2014 a publish in such manner as they think fit any notice given under subsection (1) or notification received under subsection (3), and b lay a copy of it before Parliament. Other general duties 9F 1 In the exercise of its functions, other than its functions under section 9A(2) or (3), the Financial Policy Committee must have regard to the Bank's financial stability strategy. 2 In working with the FCA or the PRA or exercising functions in relation to either of them, the Committee must, so far as it is possible to do so while complying with section 9C(1), seek to avoid exercising the Committee's functions in a way that would prejudice\u2014 a the advancement by the FCA of any of its operational objectives, or b the advancement by the PRA of any of its objectives. 3 In the exercise of its functions, the Committee must also have regard to\u2014 a the principle that a burden or restriction which is imposed on a person, or on the carrying on of an activity, should be proportionate to the benefits, considered in general terms, which are expected to result from the imposition of that burden or restriction; b the contribution to the achievement by the Bank of the Financial Stability Objective that the Committee can make by disclosing its views about possible systemic risks or disclosing other information about possible systemic risks; c the international obligations of the United Kingdom, particularly where relevant to the exercise of the powers of the Committee in relation to the FCA or the PRA.

Directions by Financial Policy Committee Directions to FCA or PRA requiring macro-prudential measures 9H 1 The Financial Policy Committee may give a direction to the FCA or the PRA (\u201cthe regulator\u201d) requiring the regulator to exercise its functions so as to ensure the implementation, by or in relation to a specified class of regulated persons, of a macro-prudential measure described in the direction. 2 \u201c Regulated person \u201d means\u2014 a in relation to the FCA\u2014 i an authorised person within the meaning of FSMA 2000, ii a recognised investment exchange within the meaning of that Act, or iii an  EEA  market operator as defined by section 312D of that Act; b in relation to the PRA, a PRA-authorised person within the meaning of that Act. 3 \u201c Macro-prudential measure \u201d is to be read in accordance with section 9L. 4 The direction may relate to all regulated persons or to regulated persons of a specified description, but may not relate to a specified regulated person. 5 The direction\u2014 a may refer to the opinion of the regulator or require or authorise the exercise of a discretion by the regulator; b may be expressed to remain in force for a specified period or until revoked. 6 The direction may not require its provisions to be implemented by specified means or within a specified period, but may include recommendations as to the means to be used and the timing of implementation. 7 A recommendation made under subsection (6) may be expressed to be one to which section 9Q(3) (duty to comply or explain) applies. 8 The direction may not require the regulator to do anything that it has no power to do, but the existence of the direction is relevant to the exercise of any discretion conferred on the regulator. 9 The direction may specify particular matters to which the regulator is or is not to have regard in complying with the direction, but those matters must be specified in relation to all regulated persons or a class of regulated person rather than a specified regulated person. 10 The direction may refer to a publication issued by the FCA, the PRA, another body in the United Kingdom or an international organisation, as the publication has effect from time to time. Compliance with directions under section 9H 9I 1 The regulator must comply with a direction given to it under section 9H as soon as reasonably practicable. 2 An order under section 9L may, in relation to cases where the regulator is complying with a direction under section 9H, exclude or modify any procedural requirement that would otherwise apply under FSMA 2000 in relation to the exercise by the regulator of its functions in pursuance of the direction. 3 The regulator to which a direction under section 9H is given must give the Financial Policy Committee one or more reports on how it is complying or has complied with the direction. 4 The Financial Policy Committee may give directions to the regulator specifying the times by which reports required by subsection (3) must be given to the Committee. 5 \u201c Regulator \u201d has the same meaning as in section 9H. Revocation of directions under section 9H 9J 1 The Financial Policy Committee may at any time by notice to the regulator revoke a direction under section 9H. 2 A direction under section 9H is to be taken to be revoked if the measure to which it relates ceases to be a macro-prudential measure, but this is subject to any provision made under section 9L(4)(e). 3 The revocation of a direction under section 9H does not affect the validity of anything previously done in accordance with it. 4 \u201c Regulator \u201d has the same meaning as in section 9H. Further provisions about directions under section 9H 9K 1 Each of the following must be in writing\u2014 a a direction under section 9H; b a notice revoking such a direction; c a report under section 9I(3). 2 The Financial Policy Committee must give the Treasury a copy of any direction under section 9H or any notice revoking such a direction. 3 The Treasury may, if they think fit, lay before Parliament a copy of a direction under section 9H or a notice revoking such a direction. 4 Where a direction under section 9H, or a notice revoking such a direction, is included in a record published under section 9U, the Treasury must, if they have not already done so, lay before Parliament a copy of the direction or notice in the form in which it is published in the record. Macro-prudential measures 9L 1 For the purposes of section 9H a  \u201cmacro-prudential measure\u201d is a measure prescribed by the Treasury by order. 2 Before making an order under this section, the Treasury must\u2014 a consult the Financial Policy Committee, or b if the Treasury consider that the delay involved in consulting the Committee would be prejudicial to the stability of the UK financial system, consult the Governor of the Bank. 3 In prescribing a measure, the order must specify whether the measure is prescribed in relation to the FCA, the PRA, or both. 4 An order under this section\u2014 a may make different provision for different cases; b may confer a discretion on the Financial Policy Committee, the FCA or the PRA; c may refer to rules made by the FCA or the PRA; d may refer to a publication issued by the FCA, the PRA, another body in the United Kingdom or an international organisation, as the publication has effect from time to time; e may contain transitional provisions and savings relating to the coming into force of any provision of the order or to the ceasing to be in force of any temporary provision made by the order. Statements of policy by Financial Policy Committee 9M 1 In relation to each macro-prudential measure prescribed under section 9L, the Financial Policy Committee must prepare and maintain a written statement of the general policy that it proposes to follow in relation to the exercise of its power of direction under section 9H so far as it relates to that measure. 2 The Committee may at any time alter or replace a statement maintained under this section. 3 The Bank must publish each statement maintained under this section. 4 Publication is to be in such manner as the Bank thinks fit. 5 Nothing in this section is to be regarded as preventing the Financial Policy Committee from exercising its power of direction under section 9H in relation to a macro-prudential measure, where it considers it necessary to do so by reason of urgency, before it has prepared a statement under this section in relation to that measure. Parliamentary control of orders under section 9L 9N 1 Except as provided by subsection (2), an order under section 9L is not to be made unless a draft of the order has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament. 2 An order under section 9L may be made without a draft having been laid and approved as mentioned in subsection (1) if the order contains a statement that the Treasury are of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make the order without a draft being so laid and approved. 3 An order under section 9L made in accordance with subsection (2)\u2014 a must be laid before Parliament after being made, and b ceases to have effect at the end of the relevant period unless before the end of that period the order is approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament (but without affecting anything done under the order or the power to make a new order). 4 The  \u201crelevant period\u201d is a period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the order is made. 5 In reckoning the relevant period no account is to be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which either House is adjourned for more than 4 days. Recommendations by Financial Policy Committee Making of recommendations within the Bank 9O 1 The Financial Policy Committee may make recommendations within the Bank. 2 The recommendations may, in particular, relate to\u2014 a the provision by the Bank of financial assistance to financial institutions; b the exercise by the Bank of its functions in relation to payment systems, settlement systems and clearing houses. 3 The Committee may not make recommendations about\u2014 a the provision by the Bank of financial assistance in relation to a particular financial institution, or b the exercise by the Bank of its powers under Parts 1 to 3 of the Banking Act 2009 in relation to a particular institution. 4 The recommendations must be made or confirmed in writing. Recommendations to Treasury 9P 1 The Financial Policy Committee may make recommendations to the Treasury. 2 The recommendations may, in particular, relate to the exercise by the Treasury of their power to make orders under\u2014 a section 9L (macro-prudential measures), b section 22(1) or (1A) of FSMA 2000 (regulated activities), c section 22A(1) of that Act (designation of activities requiring prudential regulation by PRA), d section 137D(1)(b) of that Act (purposes for which FCA may make product intervention rules), or e section 165A(2)(d) of that Act (additional persons who may be required by PRA to provide information). 3 The recommendations must be made or confirmed in writing. 4 The Committee may make a recommendation under subsection (2)(e) only if it considers that the exercise by the Treasury of their power to make an order under section 165A(2)(d) of FSMA 2000 in the manner proposed is desirable for the purposes of the exercise by the Committee of its functions. 5 Before giving a recommendation under subsection (2)(e), the Committee must consult the Treasury. Recommendations to FCA and PRA 9Q 1 The Financial Policy Committee may make recommendations to the FCA and the PRA about the exercise of their respective functions. 2 The recommendations may relate to all regulated persons or to regulated persons of a specified description, but may not relate to the exercise of the functions of the FCA or the PRA in relation to a specified regulated person. 3 If the recommendations are expressed to be recommendations to which this subsection applies, the body to which they are made must as soon as reasonably practicable\u2014 a act in accordance with the recommendations, or b if to any extent it does not, notify the Committee of the extent to which it has not acted in accordance with the recommendations and of the reasons for its decision. 4 The recommendations, and any notification under subsection (3)(b), must be made or confirmed in writing. 5 \u201c Regulated person \u201d has the same meaning as in section 9H. Recommendations to other persons 9R 1 The Financial Policy Committee may make recommendations to persons other than those mentioned in sections 9O to 9Q. 2 The recommendations must be made or confirmed in writing. Explanation Duty to prepare explanation 9S 1 In connection with the exercise of any of the specified powers, the Financial Policy Committee must prepare an explanation of\u2014 a the reasons for the Committee's decision to exercise the power, in the way in which it is being exercised, and b the Committee's reasons for believing that the exercise of the power, in the way in which it is being exercised, is compatible with the duties of the Committee under the following provisions\u2014 i section 9C(1) (as read with section 9C(4)), and ii section 9F. 2 The specified powers are\u2014 a the power to give a direction under section 9H; b the power to make recommendations under section 9O, so far as relating to the exercise of the Bank's functions in relation to payment systems, settlement systems and clearing houses; c the power to make recommendations under section 9P, so far as relating to the exercise by the Treasury of their power to make orders under any of the provisions mentioned in subsection (2) of that section; d the power to make recommendations under section 9Q. 3 The explanation required by subsection (1) in relation to the duty in section 9F(3)(a) must include an estimate of the costs and an estimate of the benefits that would arise from compliance with the direction or recommendation in question, unless in the opinion of the Committee it is not reasonably practicable to include such an estimate. Review Duty to review directions and recommendations 9T 1 The Financial Policy Committee must\u2014 a before the end of each review period, review each direction given by it under section 9H, other than a direction revoked before the end of the review period, and b prepare a summary of its conclusions. 2 A review period is\u2014 a in relation to the first review, the period of 12 months beginning with the day on which the direction was given, and b in relation to subsequent reviews, the period of 12 months beginning with the day on which the previous review was completed. 3 The Financial Policy Committee must maintain arrangements for the review at regular intervals of any recommendations that it has made under any of sections 9O to 9R and are of continuing relevance. 4 The purpose of a review is\u2014 a in the case of a direction, to consider whether the direction ought to be revoked, and b in the case of a recommendation, to consider whether the recommendation ought to be withdrawn.

The PRA's general duties The PRA's general objective 2B 1 In discharging its general functions the PRA must, so far as is reasonably possible, act in a way which advances its general objective. 2 The PRA's general objective is: promoting the safety and soundness of PRA-authorised persons. 3 That objective is to be advanced primarily by\u2014 a seeking to ensure that the business of PRA-authorised persons is carried on in a way which avoids any adverse effect on the stability of the UK financial system, and b seeking to minimise the adverse effect that the failure of a PRA-authorised person could be expected to have on the stability of the UK financial system. 4 The adverse effects mentioned in subsection (3) may, in particular, result from the disruption of the continuity of financial services. 5 In this Act  \u201c PRA-authorised person \u201d means an authorised person who has permission\u2014 a given under Part 4A, or b resulting from any other provision of this Act, to carry on regulated activities that consist of or include one or more PRA-regulated activities (see section 22A). 6 Subsection (1) is subject to sections 2C and 2D.

Strategy 2E 1 The PRA must\u2014 a determine its strategy in relation to its objectives, and b from time to time review, and if necessary revise, the strategy. 2 Before determining or revising its strategy, the PRA must consult the court of directors of the Bank of England about a draft of the strategy or of the revisions. 3 The PRA must determine its strategy within 12 months of the coming into force of this section. 4 The PRA must carry out and complete a review of its strategy before the end of each relevant period. 5 The relevant period is 12 months beginning with the date on which the previous review was completed, except that in the case of the first review the relevant period is the period of 12 months beginning with the date on which the strategy was determined under subsection (3). 6 The PRA must publish its strategy. 7 If the strategy is revised the PRA must publish the revised strategy. 8 Publication under subsection (6) or (7) is to be in such manner as the PRA thinks fit. Interpretation of references to objectives 2F In this Act, a reference, in relation to any function of the PRA, to the objectives of the PRA is a reference to its general objective but\u2014 a so far as the function is exercisable in relation to the activity of effecting or carrying out contracts of insurance, or PRA-authorised persons carrying on that activity, is a reference to its general objective and its insurance objective; b so far as the function is exercisable in relation to an activity to which an objective specified by order by virtue of section 2D(2) relates, or PRA-authorised persons carrying on that activity, is a reference to its general objective and the objective specified by the order. Limit on effect of sections 2B to 2D 2G Nothing in sections 2B to 2D is to be regarded as requiring the PRA to ensure that no PRA-authorised person fails. Duty to have regard to regulatory principles 2H 1 In discharging its general functions, the PRA must also have regard to\u2014 a the regulatory principles in section 3B, and b the need to minimise any adverse effect on competition in the relevant markets that may result from the manner in which the PRA discharges those functions. 2 In subsection (1)(b)  \u201c the relevant markets \u201d means the markets for services provided by PRA-authorised persons in carrying on regulated activities. Guidance about objectives 2I 1 The PRA must give, and from time to time review, guidance about how it intends to advance its objectives in discharging its general functions in relation to different categories of PRA-authorised person or PRA-regulated activity. 2 Before giving or altering any guidance complying with subsection (1), the PRA must consult the FCA. 3 The PRA must publish the guidance as for the time being in force. Interpretation of Chapter 2 2J 1 For the purposes of this Chapter, the PRA's general functions are\u2014 a its function of making rules under this Act (considered as a whole), b its function of preparing and issuing codes under this Act (considered as a whole), and c its function of determining the general policy and principles by reference to which it performs particular functions under this Act. 2 Except to the extent that an order under section 50 of the Financial Services Act 2012 (orders relating to mutual societies functions) so provides, the PRA's general functions do not include functions that are transferred functions within the meaning of section 52 of that Act. 3 For the purposes of this Chapter, the cases in which a PRA-authorised person (\u201cP\u201d) is to be regarded as failing include those where\u2014 a P enters insolvency, b any of the stabilisation options in Part 1 of the Banking Act 2009 is achieved in relation to P, or c P falls to be taken for the purposes of the compensation scheme to be unable, or likely to be unable, to satisfy claims against P. 4 In subsection (3)(a)  \u201c insolvency \u201d includes\u2014 a bankruptcy, b liquidation, c bank insolvency, d administration, e bank administration, f receivership, g a composition between P and P's creditors, and h a scheme of arrangement of P's affairs. Supervision Arrangements for supervision of PRA-authorised persons 2K The PRA must maintain arrangements for supervising PRA-authorised persons. Arrangements for consulting practitioners The PRA's general duty to consult 2L The PRA must make and maintain effective arrangements for consulting PRA-authorised persons or, where appropriate, persons appearing to the PRA to represent the interests of such persons on the extent to which its general policies and practices are consistent with its general duties under sections 2B to 2H. The PRA Practitioner Panel 2M 1 Arrangements under section 2L must include the establishment and maintenance of a panel of persons (to be known as  \u201c the PRA Practitioner Panel \u201d) to represent the interests of practitioners. 2 The PRA must appoint one of the members of the PRA Practitioner Panel to be its chair. 3 The Treasury's approval is required for the appointment or dismissal of the chair. 4 The PRA must appoint to the PRA Practitioner Panel such persons representing PRA-authorised persons as it considers appropriate. 5 The PRA may appoint to the PRA Practitioner Panel such other persons as it considers appropriate. Duty to consider representations 2N 1 The PRA must consider representations that are made to it in accordance with arrangements made under section 2L. 2 The PRA must from time to time publish in such manner as it thinks fit responses to the representations. Reviews Reviews 2O 1 The Treasury may appoint an independent person to conduct a review of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the PRA has used its resources in discharging its functions. 2 A review may be limited by the Treasury to such functions of the PRA (however described) as the Treasury may specify in appointing the person to conduct it. 3 A review is not to be concerned with the merits of the PRA's general policy or principles in pursuing the PRA's objectives. 4 On completion of a review, the person conducting it must make a written report to the Treasury\u2014 a setting out the result of the review, and b making such recommendations (if any) as the person considers appropriate. 5 A copy of the report must be\u2014 a laid before Parliament, and b published in such manner as the Treasury consider appropriate. 6 Any expenses reasonably incurred in the conduct of the review are to be met by the Treasury out of money provided by Parliament. 7 \u201c Independent \u201d means appearing to the Treasury to be independent of the PRA. Right to obtain documents and information 2P 1 A person conducting a review under section 2O\u2014 a has a right of access at any reasonable time to all such documents as the person may reasonably require for the purposes of the review, and b may require any person holding or accountable for any such document to provide such information and explanation as are reasonably necessary for that purpose. 2 Subsection (1) applies only to documents in the custody of or under the control of the PRA. 3 An obligation imposed on a person as a result of the exercise of the powers conferred by subsection (1) is enforceable by injunction or, in Scotland, by an order for specific performance under section 45 of the Court of Session Act 1988. CHAPTER 3 Further provisions relating to FCA and PRA Introductory Meaning of  \u201cregulator\u201d 3A 1 This section has effect for the interpretation of this Act. 2 The FCA and the PRA are the  \u201cregulators\u201d, and references to a regulator are to be read accordingly. 3 Subsection (2) does not affect\u2014 a the meaning of the following expressions\u2014 \u201chome state regulator\u201d; \u201chost state regulator\u201d; \u201coverseas regulator\u201d; or b the meaning of  \u201cthe appropriate regulator\u201d in Part 18 (recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses). Regulatory principles Regulatory principles to be applied by both regulators 3B 1 In relation to the regulators, the regulatory principles referred to in section 1B(5)(a) and 2H(1)(a) are as follows\u2014 a the need to use the resources of each regulator in the most efficient and economic way; b the principle that a burden or restriction which is imposed on a person, or on the carrying on of an activity, should be proportionate to the benefits, considered in general terms, which are expected to result from the imposition of that burden or restriction; c the desirability of sustainable growth in the economy of the United Kingdom in the medium or long term; d the general principle that consumers should take responsibility for their decisions; e the responsibilities of the senior management of persons subject to requirements imposed by or under this Act, including those affecting consumers, in relation to compliance with those requirements; f the desirability where appropriate of each regulator exercising its functions in a way that recognises differences in the nature of, and objectives of, businesses carried on by different persons subject to requirements imposed by or under this Act; g the desirability in appropriate cases of each regulator publishing information relating to persons on whom requirements are imposed by or under this Act, or requiring such persons to publish information, as a means of contributing to the advancement by each regulator of its objectives; h the principle that the regulators should exercise their functions as transparently as possible. 2 \u201c Consumer \u201d has the meaning given in section 1G. 3 \u201c Objectives \u201d, in relation to the FCA, means operational objectives. 4 The Treasury may by order amend subsection (2). Corporate governance Duty to follow principles of good governance 3C In managing its affairs, each regulator must have regard to such generally accepted principles of good corporate governance as it is reasonable to regard as applicable to it. Relationship between FCA and PRA Duty of FCA and PRA to ensure co-ordinated exercise of functions 3D 1 The regulators must co-ordinate the exercise of their respective functions conferred by or under this Act with a view to ensuring\u2014 a that each regulator consults the other regulator (where not otherwise required to do so) in connection with any proposed exercise of a function in a way that may have a material adverse effect on the advancement by the other regulator of any of its objectives; b that where appropriate each regulator obtains information and advice from the other regulator in connection with the exercise of its functions in relation to matters of common regulatory interest in cases where the other regulator may be expected to have relevant information or relevant expertise; c that where either regulator exercises functions in relation to matters of common regulatory interest, both regulators comply with their respective duties under section 1B(5)(a) or 2H(1)(a), so far as relating to the regulatory principles in section 3B(1)(a) and (b). 2 The duty in subsection (1) applies only to the extent that compliance with the duty\u2014 a is compatible with the advancement by each regulator of any of its objectives, and b does not impose a burden on the regulators that is disproportionate to the benefits of compliance. 3 A function conferred on either regulator by or under this Act relates to matters of common regulatory interest if\u2014 a the other regulator exercises similar or related functions in relation to the same persons, b the other regulator exercises functions which relate to different persons but relate to similar subject-matter, or c its exercise could affect the advancement by the other regulator of any of its objectives. 4 \u201c Objectives \u201d, in relation to the FCA, means operational objectives. Memorandum of understanding 3E 1 The regulators must prepare and maintain a memorandum which describes in general terms\u2014 a the role of each regulator in relation to the exercise of functions conferred by or under this Act which relate to matters of common regulatory interest, and b how the regulators intend to comply with section 3D in relation to the exercise of such functions. 2 The memorandum may in particular contain provisions about how the regulators intend to comply with section 3D in relation to\u2014 a applications for Part 4A permission; b the variation of permission; c the imposition of requirements; d the obtaining and disclosure of information; e cases where a PRA-authorised person is a member of a group whose other members include one or more other authorised persons (whether or not PRA-authorised persons); f functions under Schedule 3 (EEA passport rights) and Schedule 4 (Treaty rights); g the making of rules; h directions under section 138A (modification or waiver of rules); i powers to appoint competent persons under Part 11 (information gathering and investigations) to conduct investigations on their behalf; j functions under Part 12 (control over authorised persons); k functions under Part 13 (incoming firms: intervention by regulator); l functions under Part 19 (Lloyd's); m functions under section 347 (record of authorised persons  etc. ); n functions under Part 24 (insolvency); o fees payable to either regulator. 3 The memorandum must contain provision about the co-ordination by the regulators of\u2014 a the exercise of their functions relating to membership of, and their relations with, the European Supervisory Authorities (namely, the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority), b their relations with regulatory bodies outside the United Kingdom, and c the exercise of their functions in relation to the compensation scheme. 4 The regulators must review the memorandum at least once in each calendar year. 5 The regulators must give the Treasury a copy of the memorandum and any revised memorandum. 6 The Treasury must lay before Parliament a copy of any document received by them under this section. 7 The regulators must ensure that the memorandum as currently in force is published in the way appearing to them to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public. 8 The memorandum need not relate to any aspect of compliance with section 3D if the regulators consider\u2014 a that publication of information about that aspect would be against the public interest, or b that that aspect is a technical or operational matter not affecting the public. 9 The reference in subsection (1)(a) to matters of common regulatory interest is to be read in accordance with section 3D(3). With-profits insurance policies 3F 1 The regulators must prepare and maintain a memorandum which describes in general terms\u2014 a the role of each regulator in relation to the exercise of functions conferred by or under this Act so far as they relate to with-profits insurers, and b how the regulators intend to comply with section 3D in relation to the exercise of those functions so far as they relate to the effecting or carrying out of with-profits policies by with-profits insurers. 2 The memorandum required by this section may be combined with the memorandum required by section 3E. 3 If the memorandum required by this section is contained in a separate document, the PRA and the FCA must publish the memorandum as currently in force in such manner as they think fit. 4 Subsections (1) to (3) apply only if the effecting or carrying out of with-profits policies is a PRA-regulated activity. 5 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a a  \u201cwith-profits policy\u201d is a contract of insurance under which the policyholder is eligible to receive a financial benefit at the discretion of the insurer; b a  \u201cwith-profits insurer\u201d is a PRA-authorised person who has a Part 4A permission, or permission resulting from any other provision of this Act, relating to the effecting or carrying out of with-profits policies (whether or not the permission also relates to contracts of insurance of other kinds). 6 The Treasury may by order amend the definition of  \u201cwith-profits policy\u201d applying for the purposes of this section. Power to establish boundary between FCA and PRA responsibilities 3G 1 The Treasury may by order specify matters that, in relation to the exercise by either regulator of its functions relating to PRA-authorised persons, are to be, or are to be primarily, the responsibility of one regulator rather than the other. 2 The order may\u2014 a provide that one regulator is or is not to have regard to specified matters when exercising specified functions; b require one regulator to consult the other. Parliamentary control of orders under section 3G 3H 1 No order may be made under section 3G unless\u2014 a a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House, or b subsection (3) applies. 2 Subsection (3) applies if an order under section 3G contains a statement that the Treasury are of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make the order without a draft being so laid and approved. 3 Where this subsection applies the order\u2014 a must be laid before Parliament after being made, and b ceases to have effect at the end of the relevant period unless before the end of that period the order is approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament (but without that affecting anything done under the order or the power to make a new order). 4 The  \u201crelevant period\u201d is a period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the order is made. 5 In calculating the relevant period no account is to be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than 4 days. Power of PRA to restrain proposed action by FCA Power of PRA to require FCA to refrain from specified action 3I 1 Where the first, second and third conditions are met, the PRA may give a direction under this section to the FCA. 2 The first condition is that the FCA is proposing\u2014 a to exercise any of its regulatory powers in relation to PRA-authorised persons generally, a class of PRA-authorised persons or a particular PRA-authorised person, or b to exercise any of its insolvency powers in relation to\u2014 i a PRA-authorised person, ii an appointed representative whose principal, or one of whose principals, is a PRA-authorised person, or iii a person who is carrying on a PRA-regulated activity in contravention of the general prohibition. 3 In subsection (2)\u2014 a \u201c regulatory powers \u201d, in relation to the FCA, means its powers in relation to the regulation of authorised persons, other than its powers in relation to consent for the purposes of section 55F or 55I or its powers under Part 24; b \u201c insolvency powers \u201d, in relation to the FCA, means its powers under Part 24. 4 The second condition is that the PRA is of the opinion that the exercise of the power in the manner proposed may\u2014 a threaten the stability of the UK financial system, or b result in the failure of a PRA-authorised person in a way that would adversely affect the UK financial system. 5 The third condition is that the PRA is of the opinion that the giving of the direction is necessary in order to avoid the possible consequence falling within subsection (4). 6 A direction under this section is a direction requiring the FCA not to exercise the power or not to exercise it in a specified manner. 7 The direction may be expressed to have effect during a specified period or until revoked. 8 The FCA is not required to comply with a direction under this section if or to the extent that in the opinion of the FCA compliance would be incompatible with any EU obligation or any other international obligation of the United Kingdom. 9 The reference in subsection (4)(b) to the  \u201cfailure\u201d of a PRA-authorised person is to be read in accordance with section 2J(3) and (4). Power of PRA in relation to with-profits policies 3J 1 Where the first, second and third conditions are met, the PRA may give a direction under this section to the FCA. 2 The first condition is that the FCA is proposing to exercise any of its regulatory powers in relation to with-profits insurers, a class of with-profits insurers or a particular with-profits insurer. 3 In subsection (2)  \u201c regulatory powers \u201d, in relation to the FCA, means its powers in relation to the regulation of authorised persons, including its powers under Part 24 (insolvency) but not its powers in relation to consent for the purposes of section 55F or 55I. 4 The second condition is that the proposed exercise of the power relates to the provision of financial benefits under with-profits policies at the discretion of the insurer, or affects or may affect the amount, timing or distribution of financial benefits that are so provided or the entitlement to future benefits that are so provided. 5 The third condition is that the PRA is of the opinion that the giving of the direction is desirable in order to advance the PRA's general objective or its insurance objective. 6 A direction under this section is a direction requiring the FCA not to exercise the power or not to exercise it in a specified manner. 7 The direction may be expressed to have effect during a specified period or until revoked. 8 The FCA is not required to comply with a direction under this section if or to the extent that in the opinion of the FCA compliance would be incompatible with any EU obligation or any other international obligation of the United Kingdom. 9 Subsections (1) to (8) apply only if the effecting or carrying out of with-profits policies is a PRA-regulated activity. 10 In this section  \u201c with-profits insurer \u201d and  \u201c with-profits policy \u201d have the same meaning as they have for the purposes of section 3F. Revocation of directions under section 3I or 3J 3K 1 The PRA may at any time by notice to the FCA revoke a direction under section 3I or 3J. 2 The revocation of a direction under section 3I or 3J does not affect the validity of anything previously done in accordance with it. Further provisions about directions under section 3I or 3J 3L 1 Before giving a direction under section 3I or 3J, the PRA must consult the FCA. 2 A direction under section 3I or 3J must be given or confirmed in writing, and must be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for giving it. 3 A notice revoking a direction under section 3I or 3J must be given or confirmed in writing. 4 The PRA must\u2014 a publish the direction and statement, or the notice, in such manner as it thinks fit, and b where the direction or notice relates to a particular authorised person or a particular with-profits insurer, give a copy of the direction and statement, or the notice, to that person. 5 The PRA must give the Treasury a copy of\u2014 a a direction under section 3I; b a statement relating to such a direction; c a notice revoking such a direction. 6 The Treasury must lay before Parliament any document received by them under subsection (5). 7 Subsection (4) does not apply where the PRA, after consulting the Treasury, decides that compliance with that subsection would be against the public interest, and at any time when this subsection excludes the application of subsection (4) in relation to a direction under section 3I, subsection (6) also does not apply. 8 Where the PRA decides that compliance with subsection (4) would be against the public interest, it must from time to time review that decision and if it subsequently decides that compliance is no longer against the public interest it must\u2014 a comply with that subsection, and b in the case of a direction under section 3I, notify the Treasury for the purposes of subsection (6). Directions relating to consolidated supervision Directions relating to consolidated supervision of groups 3M 1 This section applies where one of the regulators (\u201cthe supervising regulator\u201d), but not the other, is the competent authority for the purpose of consolidated supervision that is required in relation to some or all of the members of a group (\u201cthe relevant group\u201d) in pursuance of any of the relevant directives. 2 \u201c Consolidated supervision \u201d includes supplementary supervision. 3 The  \u201crelevant directives\u201d are\u2014 a the banking consolidation directive; b Directive  2002/87/ EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate; c Directive  2006/49/EC  on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions; d Directive  2009/138/EC  of the European Parliament and the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency  II ). 4 The supervising regulator may, if it considers it necessary to do so for the effective consolidated supervision of the relevant group, give the other regulator a direction under this section. 5 A direction under this section is a direction requiring the other regulator to exercise, or not to exercise, a relevant function in a specified manner in relation to authorised persons who are members of the relevant group. 6 The direction may relate to members of the relevant group other than the members in respect of which consolidated supervision is required. 7 A  \u201c relevant function \u201d, in relation to either regulator, is a function conferred by or under this Act which relates to the regulation of authorised persons, but does not include\u2014 a the regulator's function of making rules under this Act; b its function of preparing and issuing codes under this Act; c its function of determining the general policy and principles by reference to which it performs particular functions; d the FCA's functions in relation to the giving of general guidance; e the PRA's functions in relation to the giving of guidance under section 2I; f the FCA's functions in relation to consent for the purposes of section 55F or 55I. 8 The direction may not require the regulator to which it is given (\u201cthe directed regulator\u201d) to do anything that it has no power to do, but the direction is relevant to the exercise of any discretion conferred on the directed regulator. 9 The directed regulator must comply with the direction as soon as practicable, but this is subject to subsections (10) and (11). 10 The directed regulator is not required to comply with a direction under this section if or to the extent that in its opinion compliance would be incompatible with any EU obligation or any other international obligation of the United Kingdom. 11 Directions given by the FCA under this section are subject to any directions given to the FCA under section 3I or 3J. Revocation of directions under section 3M 3N 1 The supervising regulator may at any time by notice to the other regulator revoke a direction under section 3M. 2 The revocation of the direction does not affect the validity of anything previously done in accordance with it. 3 Expressions defined for the purposes of section 3M have the same meaning in this section. Further provisions about directions under section 3M 3O 1 Before giving a direction under section 3M, the supervising regulator must consult the other regulator. 2 A direction under section 3M must be given or confirmed in writing, and must be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for giving it. 3 A notice revoking a direction under section 3M must be given or confirmed in writing. 4 The regulator to which a direction under section 3M is given must give a copy of the direction and statement to each of the authorised persons to whom the direction relates. 5 The supervising regulator must publish the direction and statement, or the notice, in such manner as it thinks fit. 6 But subsection (4) or (5) does not apply in a case where the regulator on which the duty is imposed considers that compliance with that subsection would be against the public interest. 7 In a case where a regulator decides that compliance with subsection (4) or (5) would be against the public interest, the regulator must from time to time review that decision and if it subsequently decides that compliance is no longer against the public interest it must comply with the subsection. 8 Expressions defined for the purposes of section 3M have the same meaning in this section. Consultation by regulator complying with direction 3P 1 If the directed regulator is required by this Act to consult any person other than the supervising regulator before exercising the relevant function to which the direction relates, the directed regulator must give the supervising regulator copies of any written representations received from the persons consulted. 2 Expressions defined for the purposes of section 3M have the same meaning in this section.

Variation or cancellation on initiative of regulator 55J 1 Either regulator may exercise its power under this section in relation to an authorised person with a Part 4A permission (\u201cA\u201d) if it appears to the regulator that\u2014 a A is failing, or is likely to fail, to satisfy the threshold conditions for which the regulator is responsible, b A has failed, during a period of at least 12 months, to carry on a regulated activity to which the Part 4A permission relates, or c it is desirable to exercise the power in order to advance\u2014 i in the case of the FCA, one or more of its operational objectives, ii in the case of the PRA, any of its objectives. 2 The FCA's power under this section is the power\u2014 a to vary the Part 4A permission by\u2014 i adding a regulated activity other than a PRA-regulated activity to those to which the permission relates, ii removing a regulated activity from those to which the permission relates, or iii varying the description of a regulated activity to which the permission relates in a way which, if it is a PRA-regulated activity, does not, in the opinion of the FCA, widen the description, or b to cancel the Part 4A permission. 3 The PRA's power under this section is the power\u2014 a in the case of a PRA-authorised person, to vary the Part 4A permission in any of the ways mentioned in section 55I(1) or to cancel it; b in the case of an authorised person who is not a PRA-authorised person, to vary the Part 4A permission by adding a PRA-regulated activity to those to which the permission relates and, if the PRA does so, to vary the Part 4A permission in any of the other ways mentioned in section 55I(1). 4 The FCA\u2014 a must consult the PRA before exercising its power under this section in relation to\u2014 i a PRA-authorised person, or ii a member of a group which includes a PRA-authorised person, and b in the case of a PRA-authorised person, may exercise the power so as to add a new activity to those to which the permission relates or to widen the description of a regulated activity to which the permission relates, only with the consent of the PRA. 5 The PRA\u2014 a must consult the FCA before exercising its power under this section, and b may exercise the power so as to add a new activity to those to which the permission relates or to widen the description of a regulated activity to which the permission relates, only with the consent of the FCA. 6 Without prejudice to the generality of subsections (1) to (3), a regulator may, in relation to an authorised person who is an investment firm, exercise its power under this section to cancel the Part 4A permission if it appears to it that any of the conditions in section 55K is met. 7 Without prejudice to the generality of subsections (1) and (2), the FCA may, in relation to an authorised person who has permission to carry on the regulated activity specified in article 24A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (which relates to bids in emission allowance auctions), exercise its power under this section to vary the Part 4A permission of the person concerned by removing that activity from those to which the permission relates if it appears to the FCA that the person has seriously and systematically infringed the provisions of paragraph 2 or 3 of Article 59 of the emission allowance auctioning regulation. 8 If, as a result of a variation of a Part 4A permission under this section, there are no longer any regulated activities for which the authorised person concerned has permission, the regulator responsible for the variation must, once it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary to keep the permission in force, cancel it. 9 Before cancelling under subsection (8) a Part 4A permission which relates to a person who (before the variation) was a PRA-authorised person, the regulator must consult the other regulator. 10 The power of either regulator to vary a Part 4A permission under this section extends to including in the permission as varied any provision that could be included if a fresh permission were being given in response to an application to that regulator under section 55A. 11 Consent given by one regulator for the purpose of subsection (4)(b) or (5)(b) may be conditional on the manner in which the other regulator exercises its powers under section 55E(4) and (5) or 55F(3) and (4) (as a result of subsection (10)). 12 The power of the FCA or the PRA under this section is referred to in this Part as its own-initiative variation power. Investment firms: particular conditions that enable cancellation 55K 1 The conditions referred to in section 55J(6) are as follows\u2014 a that the firm has failed, during a period of at least 6 months, to carry on a regulated activity which is an investment service or activity for which it has a Part 4A permission; b that the firm obtained the Part 4A permission by making a false statement or by other irregular means; c that the firm no longer satisfies the requirements for authorisation pursuant to Chapter I of Title II of the markets in financial instruments directive, or pursuant to or contained in any EU legislation made under that Chapter, in relation to a regulated activity which is an investment service or activity for which it has a Part 4A permission; d that the firm has seriously and systematically infringed the operating conditions pursuant to Chapter II of Title II of the markets in financial instruments directive, or pursuant to or contained in any EU legislation made under that Chapter, in relation to a regulated activity which is an investment service or activity for which it has a Part 4A permission. 2 For the purposes of this section a regulated activity is an investment service or activity if it falls within the definition of  \u201cinvestment services and activities\u201d in section 417(1). Imposition and variation of requirements Imposition of requirements by FCA 55L 1 Where a person has applied (whether to the FCA or the PRA) for a Part 4A permission or the variation of a Part 4A permission, the FCA may impose on that person such requirements, taking effect on or after the giving or variation of the permission, as the FCA considers appropriate. 2 The FCA may exercise its power under subsection (3) in relation to an authorised person with a Part 4A permission (whether given by it or by the PRA) (\u201cA\u201d) if it appears to the FCA that\u2014 a A is failing, or is likely to fail, to satisfy the threshold conditions for which the FCA is responsible, b A has failed, during a period of at least 12 months, to carry on a regulated activity to which the Part 4A permission relates, or c it is desirable to exercise the power in order to advance one or more of the FCA's operational objectives. 3 The FCA's power under this subsection is a power\u2014 a to impose a new requirement, b to vary a requirement imposed by the FCA under this section, or c to cancel such a requirement. 4 The FCA's power under subsection (3) is referred to in this Part as its own-initiative requirement power. 5 The FCA may, on the application of an authorised person with a Part 4A permission\u2014 a impose a new requirement, b vary a requirement imposed by the FCA under this section, or c cancel such a requirement. 6 The FCA may refuse an application under subsection (5) if it appears to it that it is desirable to do so in order to advance any of its operational objectives. 7 The FCA must consult the PRA before imposing or varying a requirement which relates to\u2014 a a person who is, or will on the granting of an application for Part 4A permission be, a PRA-authorised person, or b a person who is a member of a group which includes a PRA-authorised person. Imposition of requirements by PRA 55M 1 Where\u2014 a a person has applied for a Part 4A permission in relation to activities which consist of or include a PRA-regulated activity, b a PRA-authorised person has applied for a Part 4A permission or the variation of a Part 4A permission, or c an authorised person other than a PRA-authorised person has applied for a Part 4A permission to be varied by adding to the regulated activities to which it relates one or more regulated activities which include a PRA-regulated activity, the PRA may impose on that person such requirements, taking effect on or after the giving or variation of the permission, as the PRA considers appropriate. 2 The PRA may exercise its power under subsection (3) in relation to a PRA-authorised person with a Part 4A permission (\u201cP\u201d) if it appears to the PRA that\u2014 a P is failing, or is likely to fail, to satisfy the threshold conditions for which the PRA is responsible, b P has failed, during a period of at least 12 months, to carry on a regulated activity to which the Part 4A permission relates, or c it is desirable to exercise the power in order to advance any of the PRA's objectives. 3 The PRA's power under this subsection is a power\u2014 a to impose a new requirement, b to vary a requirement imposed by the PRA under this section, or c to cancel such a requirement. 4 The PRA's power under subsection (3) is referred to in this Part as its own-initiative requirement power. 5 The PRA may, on the application of a PRA-authorised person with a Part 4A permission\u2014 a impose a new requirement, b vary a requirement imposed by the PRA under this section, or c cancel such a requirement. 6 The PRA may refuse an application under subsection (5) if it appears to it that it is desirable to do so in order to advance any of its objectives. 7 The PRA must consult the FCA before imposing or varying a requirement. Requirements under section 55L or 55M: further provisions 55N 1 A requirement may, in particular, be imposed\u2014 a so as to require the person concerned to take specified action, or b so as to require the person concerned to refrain from taking specified action. 2 A requirement may extend to activities which are not regulated activities. 3 A requirement may be imposed by reference to the person's relationship with\u2014 a the person's group, or b other members of the person's group. 4 A requirement may be expressed to expire at the end of such period as the regulator imposing it may specify, but the imposition of a requirement that expires at the end of a specified period does not affect the regulator's power to impose a new requirement. 5 A requirement may refer to the past conduct of the person concerned (for example, by requiring the person concerned to review or take remedial action in respect of past conduct). 6 In this section  \u201c requirement \u201d means a requirement imposed under section 55L or 55M. Imposition of requirements on acquisition of control 55O 1 This section applies if it appears to the appropriate regulator that\u2014 a a person has acquired control over a UK authorised person who has a Part 4A permission, but b there are no grounds for exercising its own-initiative requirement power. 2 If it appears to the appropriate regulator that the likely effect of the acquisition of control on the UK authorised person, or on any of its activities, is uncertain, the appropriate regulator may\u2014 a impose on the UK authorised person a requirement that could be imposed by that regulator under section 55L or 55M (as the case may be) on the giving of permission, or b vary a requirement imposed by that regulator under that section on the UK authorised person. 3 \u201c The appropriate regulator \u201d means\u2014 a in a case where the UK authorised person is a PRA-authorised person, the FCA or the PRA; b in any other case, the FCA. 4 This section does not affect any duty of the appropriate regulator to consult or obtain the consent of the other regulator in connection with the imposition of the requirement. 5 Any reference to a person having acquired control is to be read in accordance with Part 12. Prohibitions and restrictions 55P 1 This section applies if\u2014 a on a person being given a Part 4A permission, either regulator imposes an assets requirement on that person, b an assets requirement is imposed on an authorised person, or c an assets requirement previously imposed on such a person is varied. 2 A person on whom an assets requirement is imposed is referred to in this section as  \u201c A \u201d. 3 The  \u201cappropriate regulator\u201d is the regulator which imposed the requirement. 4 \u201c Assets requirement \u201d means a requirement under section 55L or 55M\u2014 a prohibiting the disposal of, or other dealing with, any of A's assets (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) or restricting such disposals or dealings, or b that all or any of A's assets, or all or any assets belonging to consumers but held by A or to A's order, must be transferred to and held by a trustee approved by the appropriate regulator. 5 If the appropriate regulator\u2014 a imposes a requirement of the kind mentioned in subsection (4)(a), and b gives notice of the requirement to any institution with whom A keeps an account, the notice has the effects mentioned in subsection (6). 6 Those effects are that\u2014 a the institution does not act in breach of any contract with A if, having been instructed by A (or on A's behalf) to transfer any sum or otherwise make any payment out of A's account, it refuses to do so in the reasonably held belief that complying with the instruction would be incompatible with the requirement, and b if the institution complies with such an instruction, it is liable to pay to the appropriate regulator an amount equal to the amount transferred from, or otherwise paid out of, A's account in contravention of the requirement. 7 If the appropriate regulator imposes a requirement of the kind mentioned in subsection (4)(b), no assets held by a person as trustee in accordance with the requirement may, while the requirement is in force, be released or dealt with except with the consent of the appropriate regulator. 8 If, while a requirement of the kind mentioned in subsection (4)(b) is in force, A creates a charge over any assets of A held in accordance with the requirement, the charge is (to the extent that it confers security over the assets) void against the liquidator and any of A's creditors. 9 Assets held by a person as trustee (\u201cT\u201d) are to be taken to be held by T in accordance with any requirement mentioned in subsection (4)(b) only if\u2014 a A has given T written notice that those assets are to be held by T in accordance with the requirement, or b they are assets into which assets to which paragraph (a) applies have been transposed by T on the instructions of A. 10 A person who contravenes subsection (7) is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale. 11 \u201c Charge \u201d includes a mortgage (or in Scotland a security over property). 12 Subsections (7) and (9) do not affect any equitable interest or remedy in favour of a person who is a beneficiary of a trust as a result of a requirement of the kind mentioned in subsection (4)(b). Exercise of power in support of overseas regulator Exercise of power in support of overseas regulator 55Q 1 Either UK regulator's own-initiative powers may be exercised in respect of an authorised person at the request of, or for the purpose of assisting, an overseas regulator of a prescribed kind. 2 Subsection (1) applies whether or not the UK regulator has powers which are exercisable in relation to the authorised person by virtue of any provision of Part 13. 3 Subsection (1) does not affect any duty of one UK regulator to consult or obtain the consent of the other UK regulator in relation to the exercise of its own-initiative powers. 4 If a request to a UK regulator for the exercise of its own-initiative powers has been made by an overseas regulator who is\u2014 a of a prescribed kind, and b acting in pursuance of provisions of a prescribed kind, the UK regulator must, in deciding whether or not to exercise those powers in response to the request, consider whether it is necessary to do so in order to comply with an EU obligation. 5 In deciding whether or not to do so, in any case in which the UK regulator does not consider that the exercise of its own-initiative powers is necessary in order to comply with an EU obligation, it may take into account in particular\u2014 a whether in the country or territory of the overseas regulator concerned, corresponding assistance would be given to a United Kingdom regulatory authority; b whether the case concerns the breach of a law, or other requirement, which has no close parallel in the United Kingdom or involves the assertion of a jurisdiction not recognised by the United Kingdom; c the seriousness of the case and its importance to persons in the United Kingdom; d whether it is otherwise appropriate in the public interest to give the assistance sought. 6 The UK regulator may decide not to exercise its own-initiative powers, in response to a request, unless the overseas regulator concerned undertakes to make such contribution towards the cost of their exercise as the UK regulator considers appropriate. 7 Subsection (6) does not apply if the UK regulator decides that it is necessary for it to exercise its own-initiative powers in order to comply with an EU obligation. 8 In subsection (6)  \u201c request \u201d means a request of a kind mentioned in subsection (1). 9 In this section\u2014 a \u201c UK regulator \u201d means the FCA or the PRA; b \u201c overseas regulator \u201d means a regulator outside the United Kingdom; c \u201c own-initiative powers \u201d, in relation to the FCA or the PRA, means its own-initiative variation power and its own-initiative requirement power. Connected persons Persons connected with an applicant 55R 1 In considering\u2014 a an application for a Part 4A permission, b whether to vary or cancel a Part 4A permission, c whether to impose or vary a requirement under this Part, or d whether to give any consent required by any provision of this Part, the regulator concerned may have regard to any person appearing to it to be, or likely to be, in a relationship with the applicant or a person given permission which is relevant. 2 Before\u2014 a giving permission in response to an application under section 55A made by a person who is connected with an EEA firm (other than an EEA firm falling within paragraph 5(e) of Schedule 3 (insurance and reinsurance intermediaries)), or b cancelling or varying a Part 4A permission given to such a person, the regulator concerned must in prescribed circumstances consult the firm's home state regulator. 3 A person (\u201cA\u201d) is connected with an EEA firm if\u2014 a A is a subsidiary undertaking of the firm, or b A is a subsidiary undertaking of a parent undertaking of the firm. Additional permissions Duty of FCA or PRA to consider other permissions 55S 1 \u201cAdditional Part 4A permission\u201d \u2014 a in relation to either regulator, means a Part 4A permission which is in force in relation to an EEA firm or a Treaty firm, and b in relation to the FCA, also includes a Part 4A permission which is in force in relation to a person authorised as a result of paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 5. 2 If either regulator is considering whether, and if so how, to exercise its own-initiative variation power or its own-initiative requirement power in relation to an additional Part 4A permission, it must take into account\u2014 a the home state authorisation of the authorised person concerned, b any relevant directive, and c relevant provisions of the Treaty. Persons whose interests are protected Persons whose interests are protected 55T For the purpose of any provision of this Part which refers to the FCA's operational objectives, or the PRA's objectives in relation to the exercise of a power in relation to a particular person, it does not matter whether there is a relationship between that person and the persons whose interests will be protected by the exercise of the power. Procedure Applications under this Part 55U 1 An application for a Part 4A permission must\u2014 a contain a statement of the regulated activity or regulated activities which the applicant proposes to carry on and for which the applicant wishes to have permission, and b give the address of a place in the United Kingdom for service on the applicant of any notice or other document which is required or authorised to be served on the applicant under this Act. 2 An application for the variation of a Part 4A permission must contain a statement\u2014 a of the desired variation, and b of the regulated activity or regulated activities which the applicant proposes to carry on if the permission is varied. 3 An application for the variation of a requirement imposed under section 55L or 55M or for the imposition of a new requirement must contain a statement of the desired variation or requirement. 4 An application under this Part must\u2014 a be made in such manner as the regulator to which it is to be made may direct, and b contain, or be accompanied by, such other information as that regulator may reasonably require. 5 At any time after the application is received and before it is determined, the appropriate regulator may require the applicant to provide it with such further information as it reasonably considers necessary to enable it to determine the application or, as the case requires, to decide whether to give consent. 6 In subsection (5), the  \u201c appropriate regulator \u201d means\u2014 a in a case where the application is made to the FCA, the FCA; b in a case where the application is made to the PRA, the FCA or the PRA. 7 Different directions may be given, and different requirements imposed, in relation to different applications or categories of application. 8 Each regulator may require an applicant to provide information which the applicant is required to provide to it under this section in such form, or to verify it in such a way, as the regulator may direct. 9 The PRA must consult the FCA before\u2014 a giving a direction under this section in relation to a class of applications, or b imposing a requirement under this section in relation to a class of applications. Determination of applications 55V 1 An application under this Part must be determined by the regulator to which it is required to be made (\u201cthe appropriate regulator\u201d) before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the date on which it received the completed application. 2 The appropriate regulator may determine an incomplete application if it considers it appropriate to do so; and it must in any event determine such an application within 12 months beginning with the date on which it received the application. 3 Where the application cannot be determined by the appropriate regulator without the consent of the other regulator, the other regulator's decision must also be made within the period required by subsection (1) or (2). 4 The applicant may withdraw the application, by giving the appropriate regulator written notice, at any time before the appropriate regulator determines it. 5 If the appropriate regulator grants an application\u2014 a for Part 4A permission, b for the variation or cancellation of a Part 4A permission, c for the variation or cancellation of a requirement imposed under section 55L or 55M, or d for the imposition of a new requirement under either of those sections, it must give the applicant written notice. 6 The notice must state the date from which the permission, variation, cancellation or requirement has effect. 7 A notice under this section which is given by the PRA and relates to the grant of an application for Part 4A permission or for the variation of a Part 4A permission must state that the FCA has given its consent to the grant of the application. Applications under this Part: communications between regulators 55W The PRA must as soon as practicable notify the FCA of the receipt or withdrawal of\u2014 a an application for permission under section 55A, b an application under section 55I, or c an application under section 55M(5). Determination of applications: warning notices and decision notices 55X 1 If a regulator proposes\u2014 a to give a Part 4A permission but to exercise its power under section 55E(5)(a) or (b) or 55F(4)(a) or (b), b to give a Part 4A permission but to exercise its power under section 55L(1) or 55M(1) in connection with the application for permission, c to vary a Part 4A permission on the application of an authorised person but to exercise its power under section 55E(5)(a) or (b) or 55F(4)(a) or (b), d to vary a Part 4A permission but to exercise its power under section 55L(1) or 55M(1) in connection with the application for variation, or e in the case of the FCA, to exercise its power under section 55L(1) in connection with an application to the PRA for a Part 4A permission or the variation of a Part 4A permission, it must give the applicant a warning notice. 2 If a regulator proposes to refuse an application made under this Part, it must (unless subsection (3) applies) give the applicant a warning notice. 3 This subsection applies if it appears to the regulator that\u2014 a the applicant is an EEA firm, and b the application is made with a view to carrying on a regulated activity in a manner in which the applicant is, or would be, entitled to carry on that activity in the exercise of an EEA right whether through a United Kingdom branch or by providing services in the United Kingdom. 4 If a regulator decides\u2014 a to give a Part 4A permission but to exercise its power under section 55E(5)(a) or (b) or 55F(4)(a) or (b), b to give a Part 4A permission but to exercise its power under section 55L(1) or 55M(1) in connection with the giving of the permission, c to vary a Part 4A permission on the application of an authorised person but to exercise its power under section 55E(5)(a) or (b) or 55F(4)(a) or (b), d to vary a Part 4A permission on the application of an authorised person but to exercise its power under section 55L(1) or 55M(1) in connection with the variation, e in the case of the FCA, to exercise its power under section 55L(1) in connection with an application to the PRA for a Part 4A permission or the variation of a Part 4A permission, or f to refuse an application under this Part, it must give the applicant a decision notice. Exercise of own-initiative power: procedure 55Y 1 This section applies to an exercise of either regulator's own-initiative variation power or own-initiative requirement power in relation to an authorised person (\u201cA\u201d). 2 A variation of a permission or the imposition or variation of a requirement takes effect\u2014 a immediately, if the notice given under subsection (4) states that that is the case, b on such date as may be specified in the notice, or c if no date is specified in the notice, when the matter to which the notice relates is no longer open to review. 3 A variation of a permission, or the imposition or variation of a requirement, may be expressed to take effect immediately (or on a specified date) only if the regulator concerned, having regard to the ground on which it is exercising its own-initiative variation power or own-initiative requirement power, reasonably considers that it is necessary for the variation, or the imposition or variation of the requirement, to take effect immediately (or on that date). 4 If either regulator proposes to vary a Part 4A permission or to impose or vary a requirement, or varies a Part 4A permission or imposes or varies a requirement, with immediate effect, it must give A written notice. 5 The notice must\u2014 a give details of the variation of the permission or the requirement or its variation, b state the regulator's reasons for the variation of the permission or the imposition or variation of the requirement, c inform A that A may make representations to the regulator within such period as may be specified in the notice (whether or not A has referred the matter to the Tribunal), d inform A of when the variation of the permission or the imposition or variation of the requirement takes effect, and e inform A of A's right to refer the matter to the Tribunal. 6 The regulator may extend the period allowed under the notice for making representations. 7 If, having considered any representations made by A, the regulator decides\u2014 a to vary the permission, or impose or vary the requirement, in the way proposed, or b if the permission has been varied or the requirement imposed or varied, not to rescind the variation of the permission or the imposition or variation of the requirement, it must give A written notice. 8 If, having considered any representations made by A, the regulator decides\u2014 a not to vary the permission, or impose or vary the requirement, in the way proposed, b to vary the permission or requirement in a different way, or impose a different requirement, or c to rescind a variation or requirement which has effect, it must give A written notice. 9 A notice under subsection (7) must inform A of A's right to refer the matter to the Tribunal. 10 A notice under subsection (8)(b) must comply with subsection (5). 11 If a notice informs A of A's right to refer a matter to the Tribunal, it must give an indication of the procedure on such a reference. 12 For the purposes of subsection (2)(c), whether a matter is open to review is to be determined in accordance with section 391(8). Cancellation of Part 4A permission: procedure 55Z 1 If a regulator proposes to cancel an authorised person's Part 4A permission otherwise than at the person's request, it must give the person a warning notice. 2 If a regulator decides to cancel an authorised person's Part 4A permission otherwise than at the person's request, it must give the person a decision notice. Notification Notification of ESMA 55Z1 A regulator must notify ESMA of\u2014 a the giving by it of a Part 4A permission to an investment firm, where the regulated activities to which the permission relates are investment services and activities, b the giving by it of a Part 4A permission to a management company (as defined in section 237(2)), where the regulated activities to which the permission relates fall within paragraph 8 of Schedule 2, c the cancellation by it of a Part 4A permission of a description falling within paragraph (b), or d the cancellation by it of a Part 4A permission under section 55J(6), in reliance on any one or more of the conditions in section 55K(1)(b) to (d). Notification of EBA 55Z2 1 A regulator must notify EBA of\u2014 a the giving by it of a Part 4A permission to a credit institution, where the regulated activity to which the permission relates falls within paragraph 4 of Schedule 2, or b the cancellation by it of a Part 4A permission of a description falling within paragraph (a). 2 \u201c Credit institution \u201d has the meaning given in section 1H(8). References to the Tribunal Right to refer matters to the Tribunal 55Z3 1 An applicant who is aggrieved by the determination of an application made under this Part may refer the matter to the Tribunal. 2 An authorised person who is aggrieved by the exercise by either regulator of its own-initiative variation power or its own-initiative requirement power may refer the matter to the Tribunal. Interpretation Interpretation of Part 4A 55Z4 In this Part\u2014 \u201c own-initiative requirement power \u201d, in relation to the FCA or the PRA, is to be read in accordance with section 55L(4) or 55M(4); \u201c own-initiative variation power \u201d, in relation to the FCA or the PRA, is to be read in accordance with section 55J(12). 3 In Schedule 6 to FSMA 2000 (the threshold conditions), omit

b suspend, for such period as it considers appropriate, the sponsor's approval; c impose, for such period as it considers appropriate, such limitations or other restrictions in relation to the performance of services to which the sponsor's approval relates as it considers appropriate; d publish a statement to the effect that the sponsor has contravened a requirement or restriction imposed on the sponsor by rules made as a result of section 88(3)(c) or (e). 3 The period for which a suspension or restriction is to have effect may not exceed 12 months. 4 A suspension may relate only to the performance in specified circumstances of a service to which the approval relates. 5 A restriction may, in particular, be imposed so as to require the sponsor to take, or refrain from taking, specified action. 6 The FCA may\u2014 a withdraw a suspension or restriction; or b vary a suspension or restriction so as to reduce the period for which it has effect or otherwise to limit its effect. 7 The FCA may not take action against a sponsor under this section after the end of the limitation period unless, before the end of that period, it has given a warning notice to the sponsor under section 88B(1). 8 \u201c The limitation period \u201d means the period of 3 years beginning with the first day on which the FCA knew that the sponsor had contravened the requirement or restriction. 9 For this purpose the FCA is to be treated as knowing that a sponsor has contravened a requirement or restriction if it has information from which that can reasonably be inferred. Action under s.88A: procedure and right to refer to Tribunal 88B 1 If the FCA proposes to take action against a sponsor under section 88A, it must give the sponsor a warning notice. 2 A warning notice about a proposal to impose a penalty must state the amount of the penalty. 3 A warning notice about a proposal\u2014 a to suspend an approval, or b to impose a restriction in relation to the performance of a service, must state the period for which the suspension or restriction is to have effect. 4 A warning notice about a proposal to publish a statement must set out the terms of the statement. 5 If the FCA decides to take action against a sponsor under section 88A, it must give the sponsor a decision notice. 6 A decision notice about the imposition of a penalty must state the amount of the penalty. 7 A decision notice about\u2014 a the suspension of an approval, or b the imposition of a restriction in relation to the performance of a service, must state the period for which the suspension or restriction is to have effect. 8 A decision notice about the publication of a statement must set out the terms of the statement. 9 If the FCA decides to take action against a sponsor under section 88A, the sponsor may refer the matter to the Tribunal. Action under s.88A: statement of policy 88C 1 The FCA must prepare and issue a statement of its policy with respect to\u2014 a the imposition of penalties, suspensions or restrictions under section 88A, b the amount of penalties under that section, and c the period for which suspensions or restrictions under that section are to have effect. 2 The FCA's policy in determining what the amount of a penalty should be, or what the period for which a suspension or restriction is to have effect should be, must include having regard to\u2014 a the seriousness of the contravention in question in relation to the nature of the requirement concerned, b the extent to which that contravention was deliberate or reckless, and c whether the sponsor concerned is an individual. 3 The FCA may at any time alter or replace a statement issued under this section. 4 If a statement issued under this section is altered or replaced, the FCA must issue the altered or replacement statement. 5 In exercising, or deciding whether to exercise, its power under section 88A in the case of any particular contravention, the FCA must have regard to any statement of policy published under this section and in force at a time when the contravention in question occurred. 6 A statement issued under this section must be published by the FCA in the way appearing to the FCA to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public. 7 The FCA may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a copy of the statement. 8 The FCA must, without delay, give the Treasury a copy of any statement which it publishes under this section. Statement of policy under s.88C: procedure 88D 1 Before issuing a statement under section 88C, the FCA must publish a draft of the proposed statement in the way appearing to the FCA to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public. 2 The draft must be accompanied by notice that representations about the proposal may be made to the FCA within a specified time. 3 Before issuing the proposed statement, the FCA must have regard to any representations made to it in accordance with subsection (2). 4 If the FCA issues the proposed statement it must publish an account, in general terms, of\u2014 a the representations made to it in accordance with subsection (2), and b its response to them. 5 If the statement differs from the draft published under subsection (1) in a way which is, in the opinion of the FCA, significant, the FCA must (in addition to complying with subsection (4)) publish details of the difference. 6 The FCA may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a copy of a draft published under subsection (1). 7 This section also applies to a proposal to alter or replace a statement.

Orders under s.137D(1)(b) 137E 1 No order may be made under section 137D(1)(b) unless\u2014 a a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House, or b subsection (3) applies. 2 Subsection (3) applies if an order under section 137D(1)(b) contains a statement that the Treasury are of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make the order without a draft being so laid and approved. 3 Where this subsection applies the order\u2014 a must be laid before Parliament after being made, and b ceases to have effect at the end of the relevant period unless before the end of that period the order is approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament (but without that affecting anything done under the order or the power to make a new order). 4 The  \u201crelevant period\u201d is a period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the order is made. 5 In calculating the relevant period no account is to be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than 4 days. Rules requiring participation in benchmark 137F 1 The power of the FCA to make general rules includes power to make rules requiring authorised persons to take specified steps in connection with the setting by a specified person of a specified benchmark. 2 The rules may in particular\u2014 a require authorised persons to whom the rules apply to provide information of a specified kind, or expressions of opinion as to specified matters, to persons determined in accordance with the rules; b make provision about the form in which and the time by which any information or expression of opinion is to be provided; c make provision by reference to any code or other document published by the person responsible for the setting of the benchmark or by any other person determined in accordance with the rules, as the code or other document has effect from time to time. 3 Rules making provision of the kind mentioned in subsection (2)(c) may provide that the code or other document is to be capable of affecting obligations imposed by the rules only if specified requirements are met in relation to it. 4 In this section\u2014 \u201c benchmark \u201d has the meaning given in section 22(6); \u201c specified \u201d means specified in or determined in accordance with the rules. The PRA's general rules 137G 1 The PRA may make such rules applying to PRA-authorised persons\u2014 a with respect to the carrying on by them of regulated activities, or b with respect to the carrying on by them of activities which are not regulated activities, as appear to the PRA to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of advancing any of its objectives. 2 Rules made under this section are referred to in this Act as the PRA's general rules. 3 The PRA's general rules may make provision applying to PRA-authorised persons even though there is no relationship between the PRA-authorised persons to whom the rules will apply and the persons whose interests will be protected by the rules. 4 The PRA's general rules may contain requirements which take into account, in the case of a PRA-authorised person who is a member of a group, any activity of another member of the group. 5 The PRA's general rules may not\u2014 a make provision prohibiting an EEA firm from carrying on, or holding itself out as carrying on, any activity which it has permission conferred by Part 2 of Schedule 3 to carry on in the United Kingdom; b make provision, as respects an EEA firm, about any matter for which responsibility is, under any of the single market directives or the emission allowance auctioning regulation, reserved to the firm's home state regulator. General rules about remuneration 137H 1 This section applies where either regulator exercises its power to make general rules so as to make rules prohibiting persons, or persons of a specified description, from being remunerated in a specified way. 2 The rules may\u2014 a provide that any provision of an agreement that contravenes such a prohibition is void, and b provide for the recovery of any payment made, or other property transferred, in pursuance of a provision that is void by virtue of paragraph (a). 3 A provision that, at the time the rules are made, is contained in an agreement made before that time may not be rendered void under subsection (2)(a) unless it is subsequently amended so as to contravene a prohibition referred to in that subsection. Remuneration policies: Treasury direction to consider compliance 137I 1 This section applies where either regulator exercises its power to make general rules so as to make rules requiring authorised persons, or authorised persons of a description specified in the rules, to act in accordance with a remuneration policy. 2 A  \u201cremuneration policy\u201d is a policy about the remuneration by an authorised person of\u2014 a officers, b employees, or c other persons, of a description specified in the rules. 3 The Treasury may direct the regulator to consider whether the remuneration policies of authorised persons specified in the direction (or of authorised persons of a description so specified) comply with requirements imposed by rules made by that regulator as to the contents of the policies. 4 Before giving a direction under subsection (3), the Treasury must consult the regulator concerned. 5 If the regulator considers that a remuneration policy of an authorised person fails to make provision which complies with the requirements mentioned in subsection (3), the regulator must take such steps as it considers appropriate to deal with the failure. 6 The steps that the regulator may take include requiring the remuneration policy to be revised. 7 \u201c Authorised person \u201d, in relation to the PRA, means PRA-authorised person. Rules about recovery plans: duty to consult 137J 1 Before either regulator prepares a draft of any general rules that require each relevant person (or each relevant person of a specified description) to prepare a recovery plan, the regulator must consult\u2014 a the Treasury, and b the Bank of England. 2 A  \u201crelevant person\u201d is an authorised person in relation to whom any power under Part 1 of the Banking Act 2009 (special resolution regime) is exercisable. 3 A  \u201crecovery plan\u201d is a document containing information within subsection (4) or (5). 4 Information is within this subsection if it relates to action to be taken to secure that, in the event of specified circumstances affecting the carrying on of the business (or any part of the business) of an authorised person\u2014 a the business of the authorised person, or b a specified part of that business, is capable of being carried on (whether or not by the authorised person and whether or not in the same way as previously). 5 Information is within this subsection if it would facilitate the carrying on of the business (or any part of the business) of an authorised person by any other person. 6 In this section\u2014 \u201c authorised person \u201d, in relation to the PRA, means PRA-authorised person; \u201c specified \u201d means specified in the rules. PRA rules about resolution plans: duty to consult 137K 1 Before the PRA prepares a draft of any general rules that require each relevant person (or each relevant person of a specified description) to prepare a resolution plan, the PRA must consult\u2014 a the Treasury, and b the Bank of England. 2 A  \u201crelevant person\u201d is a PRA-authorised person in relation to whom any power under Part 1 of the Banking Act 2009 (special resolution regime) is exercisable. 3 A  \u201cresolution plan\u201d is a document containing information within subsection (4) or (5). 4 Information is within this subsection if it relates to action to be taken in the event of\u2014 a circumstances arising in which it is likely that the business (or any part of the business) of an authorised person will fail, or b the failure of the business (or any part of the business) of an authorised person. 5 Information is within this subsection if it would facilitate anything falling to be done by any person in consequence of that failure. 6 An example of information within subsection (5) is information that, in the event of that failure, would facilitate\u2014 a planning by the Treasury in relation to the possible exercise of any of its powers under Part 1 of the Banking Act 2009, or b planning by the Bank of England in relation to the possible exercise of any of its powers under Part 1, 2 or 3 of that Act. Interpretation of sections 137J and 137K 137L 1 This section has effect for the interpretation of sections 137J and 137K. 2 References to the taking of action include the taking of action by\u2014 a the authorised person, b any other person in the same group as the authorised person, or c a partnership of which the authorised person is a member. 3 In subsection (2)(b) the definition of  \u201cgroup\u201d in section 421 applies with the omission of subsection (1)(e) and (f) of that section. 4 References to the business of an authorised person include the business of\u2014 a any person in the same group as the authorised person, and b a partnership of which the authorised person is a member. 5 For the purposes of section 137K the cases in which the business (or any part of the business) of the authorised person (\u201cA\u201d) is to be regarded as having failed include those where\u2014 a A enters insolvency, b any of the stabilisation options in Part 1 of the Banking Act 2009 is achieved in relation to A, or c A falls to be taken for the purposes of the compensation scheme to be unable, or likely to be unable, to satisfy claims against A. 6 In subsection (5)(a)  \u201c insolvency \u201d includes\u2014 a bankruptcy, b liquidation, c bank insolvency, d administration, e bank administration, f receivership, g a composition between A and A's creditors, and h a scheme of arrangement of A's affairs. Special provision relating to adequacy of resolution plans 137M 1 This section applies where the PRA has exercised its power to make general rules so as to make rules requiring PRA-authorised persons, or PRA-authorised persons of a specified description, to prepare a resolution plan. 2 The PRA must consult the Treasury and the Bank of England (\u201c the Bank \u201d) about the adequacy of resolution plans required to be prepared by those rules, so far as relating to any matter which may be relevant to the exercise by the Treasury or the Bank of any power under Part 1, 2 or 3 of the Banking Act 2009. 3 After being consulted under subsection (2)\u2014 a the Treasury or the Bank may notify the PRA that, in the opinion of the Treasury or the Bank, a resolution plan fails to make satisfactory provision in relation to any such matter, and b if the Treasury or the Bank give a notification under paragraph (a), the Treasury or the Bank must give reasons for being of that opinion to the PRA. 4 The PRA must have regard to any notification given under subsection (3)(a) before considering whether any resolution plan makes satisfactory provision in relation to any such matter. 5 If\u2014 a a notification is given under subsection (3)(a), but b the PRA is nonetheless of the opinion that the resolution plan makes satisfactory provision in relation to any such matter, the PRA must give reasons for being of that opinion to the person who gave the notification. 6 In this section\u2014 \u201c resolution plan \u201d has the same meaning as in section 137K; \u201c specified \u201d means specified in the rules. Recovery plans and resolution plans: restriction on duty of confidence 137N 1 A contractual or other requirement imposed on a person (\u201cP\u201d) to keep information in confidence does not apply if\u2014 a the information is or may be relevant to anything required to be done as a result of a requirement imposed by general rules made by either regulator to prepare a recovery plan or a resolution plan, b an authorised person or a skilled person requests or requires P to provide the information for the purpose of securing that those things are done, and c the regulator in question has approved the making of the request or the imposition of the requirement before it is made or imposed. 2 An authorised person may provide information (whether received under subsection (1) or otherwise) that would otherwise be subject to a contractual or other requirement to keep it in confidence if it is provided for the purposes of anything required to be done as a result of a requirement imposed by general rules to prepare a recovery plan or a resolution plan. 3 In this section, references to preparing a recovery plan or a resolution plan include\u2014 a keeping that plan up to date, and b collecting specified information for the purposes of that plan. 4 In this section, references to a skilled person are to a person appointed in accordance with section 166A. 5 In this section\u2014 \u201c authorised person \u201d, in relation to rules of the PRA, means a PRA-authorised person; \u201c specified \u201d means specified in the rules. Specific rule-making powers Threshold condition code 137O 1 Either regulator may make rules supplementing any of the conditions for the time being set out in or specified under Schedule 6 that is expressed to be relevant to the discharge of that regulator's functions. 2 Rules made under this section by a regulator are referred to as that regulator's  \u201cthreshold condition code\u201d. 3 A threshold condition code may in particular\u2014 a specify requirements which a person must satisfy in order to be regarded as satisfying a particular condition in relation to any regulated activities; b specify matters which are, or may be, or are not, relevant in determining whether a person satisfies a particular condition in relation to any regulated activities. 4 Except where a regulator's threshold condition code so provides, it is not to be regarded as limiting the matters that are, or may be, relevant in determining whether a person satisfies a particular condition in relation to any regulated activities. 5 A threshold condition code cannot impose obligations that are enforceable against authorised persons otherwise than through the threshold conditions. Control of information rules 137P 1 Either regulator may make rules (\u201ccontrol of information rules\u201d) about the disclosure and use of information held by an authorised person (\u201cA\u201d). 2 Control of information rules may\u2014 a require the withholding of information which A would otherwise be required to disclose to a person (\u201cB\u201d) for or with whom A does business in the course of carrying on any regulated or other activity; b specify circumstances in which A may withhold information which A would otherwise be required to disclose to B; c require A not to use for the benefit of B information\u2014 i which is held by A, and ii which A would otherwise be required to use for the benefit of B; d specify circumstances in which A may decide not to use for the benefit of B information within paragraph (c). Price stabilising rules 137Q 1 The FCA may make rules (\u201cprice stabilising rules\u201d) as to\u2014 a the circumstances and manner in which, b the conditions subject to which, and c the time when or the period during which, action may be taken for the purpose of stabilising the price of investments of specified kinds. 2 Price stabilising rules\u2014 a are to be made so as to apply only to authorised persons; b may make different provision in relation to different kinds of investment. 3 The FCA may make rules which, for the purposes of the relevant exemption provisions, treat a person who acts or engages in conduct\u2014 a for the purpose of stabilising the price of investments, and b in conformity with such provisions corresponding to price stabilising rules and made by a body or authority outside the United Kingdom as may be specified in rules made by the FCA, as acting, or engaging in that conduct, for that purpose and in conformity with price stabilising rules. 4 \u201cThe relevant exemption provisions\u201d are the following provisions of the Financial Services Act 2012\u2014 a section 90(9)(b); b section 91(4)(a). Financial promotion rules 137R 1 The FCA may make rules applying to authorised persons about the communication by them, or their approval of the communication by others, of invitations or inducements\u2014 a to engage in investment activity, or b to participate in a collective investment scheme. 2 Rules under this section may, in particular, make provision about the form and content of communications. 3 Subsection (1) applies only to communications which\u2014 a if made by a person other than an authorised person, without the approval of an authorised person, would contravene section 21(1), and b may be made by an authorised person without contravening section 238(1). 4 But subsection (3) does not prevent the FCA from making rules under subsection (1) in relation to a communication that would not contravene section 21(1) if made by a person other than an authorised person, without the approval of an authorised person, if the conditions set out in subsection (5) are satisfied. 5 Those conditions are\u2014 a that the communication would not contravene subsection (1) of section 21 because it is a communication to which that subsection does not apply as a result of an order under subsection (5) of that section, b that the FCA considers that any of the requirements of\u2014 i paragraphs 1 to 8 of Article 19 of the markets in financial instruments directive, ii any implementing measure made under paragraph 10 of that Article, or iii Article 77 of the  UCITS  directive, apply to the communication, and c that the FCA considers that the rules are necessary to secure that the communication satisfies such of the requirements mentioned in paragraph (b) as the FCA considers apply to the communication. 6 \u201c Engage in investment activity \u201d has the same meaning as in section 21. 7 The Treasury may by order impose limitations on the power to make rules under this section. Financial promotion rules: directions given by FCA 137S 1 The FCA may give a direction under this section if\u2014 a an authorised person has made, or proposes to make, a communication or has approved, or proposes to approve, another person's communication, and b the FCA considers that there has been, or is likely to be, a contravention of financial promotion rules in respect of the communication or approval. 2 A direction under this section may require the authorised person\u2014 a to withdraw the communication or approval; b to refrain from making the communication or giving the approval (whether or not it has previously been made or given); c to publish details of the direction; d to do anything else specified in the direction in relation to the communication or approval. 3 A requirement in a direction under this section to refrain from making or approving a communication includes a requirement to refrain from making or approving another communication where\u2014 a the other communication is in all material respects the same as, or substantially the same as, the communication to which the direction relates, and b in all the circumstances a reasonable person would think that another direction would be given under this section in relation to the other communication. 4 The requirements contained in a direction under this section have effect as follows\u2014 a a requirement to publish details of the direction has effect at such time (if any) as the FCA gives a notice under subsection (8)(a); b any other requirement takes effect immediately. 5 If the FCA gives a direction under this section to an authorised person\u2014 a it must give written notice to the authorised person, and b if the direction relates to the approval by the authorised person of another person's communication, it must also give written notice to that other person. 6 The notice must\u2014 a give details of the direction, b inform the person to whom the notice is given that the direction takes effect immediately, c state the FCA's reasons for giving the direction, and d inform the person to whom the notice is given that the person may make representations to the FCA within such period as may be specified in the notice (which may be extended by the FCA). 7 The FCA may amend the direction if, having considered any representations made by a person to whom notice is given under subsection (5), it considers it appropriate to do so. 8 If, having considered any such representations, the FCA decides not to revoke the direction\u2014 a the FCA must give separate written notice to the persons mentioned in subsection (5)(a) or (b), and b any such person may refer the matter to the Tribunal. 9 A notice under subsection (8)(a) must\u2014 a give details of the direction and of any amendment of it, b state the FCA's reasons for deciding not to revoke the direction and, if relevant, for amending it, c inform the person to whom the notice is given of the person's right to refer the matter to the Tribunal, and d give an indication of the procedure on such a reference. 10 If, having considered any representations made by a person to whom notice is given under subsection (5), the FCA decides to revoke the direction, it must give separate written notice to those persons. 11 After the period for making representations in relation to a direction given under this section has ended, the FCA may publish such information about the direction as it considers appropriate (even if the direction is revoked). 12 Nothing in this section requires a notice to be given to a person mentioned in subsection (5)(b) if the FCA considers it impracticable to do so. Supplementary powers General supplementary powers 137T Rules made by either regulator\u2014 a may make different provision for different cases and may, in particular, make different provision in respect of different descriptions of authorised persons, activity or investment, b may make provision by reference to rules made by the other regulator, as those rules have effect from time to time, and c may contain such incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision as the regulator making the rule considers appropriate. CHAPTER 2 Rules: modification, waiver, contravention and procedural provisions Modification or waiver of rules Modification or waiver of rules 138A 1 Either regulator may, on the application or with the consent of a person who is subject to rules made by that regulator, direct that all or any of those rules\u2014 a are not to apply to that person, or b are to apply to that person with such modifications as may be specified in the direction. 2 Subsection (1) does not apply to\u2014 a rules made by either regulator under section 137O (threshold condition code); b rules made by the FCA under section 247 (trust scheme rules) or section 248 (scheme particulars rules). 3 An application must be made in such manner as the regulator may direct. 4 A regulator may not give a direction unless it is satisfied that\u2014 a compliance by the person with the rules, or with the rules as unmodified, would be unduly burdensome or would not achieve the purpose for which the rules were made, and b the direction would not adversely affect the advancement of any of the regulator's objectives. 5 In subsection (4)(b)  \u201c objectives \u201d, in relation to the FCA, means operational objectives. 6 A direction may be given subject to conditions. 7 The regulator may\u2014 a revoke a direction, or b vary it on the application, or with the consent, of the person to whom it relates. 8 \u201c Direction \u201d means a direction under this section. Publication of directions under section 138A 138B 1 Subject to subsection (2), a direction must be published by the regulator concerned in the way appearing to the regulator to be best calculated for bringing it to the attention of\u2014 a persons likely to be affected by it, and b persons who are, in the opinion of the regulator, likely to make an application for a similar direction. 2 Subsection (1) does not apply if the regulator is satisfied that it is inappropriate or unnecessary to publish the direction. 3 In deciding whether it is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2), the regulator must\u2014 a consider whether the publication of the direction would be detrimental to the stability of the UK financial system, b take into account whether the direction relates to a rule contravention of which is actionable in accordance with section 138D, c consider whether publication of the direction would prejudice, to an unreasonable degree, the commercial interests of the person concerned or any other member of the person's immediate group, and d consider whether its publication would be contrary to an international obligation of the United Kingdom. 4 The FCA must consult the PRA before publishing or deciding not to publish a direction which relates to\u2014 a a PRA-authorised person, or b an authorised person who has as a member of its immediate group a PRA-authorised person. 5 For the purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (3), the regulator must consider whether it would be possible to publish the direction without either of the consequences mentioned in those paragraphs by publishing it without disclosing the identity of the person concerned. 6 \u201c Direction \u201d means a direction under section 138A. Contravention of rules Evidential provisions 138C 1 If a particular rule made by either regulator so provides, contravention of the rule does not give rise to any of the consequences provided for by other provisions of this Act. 2 A rule made by a regulator which so provides must also provide\u2014 a that contravention may be relied on as tending to establish contravention of such other rule made by that regulator as may be specified, or b that compliance may be relied on as tending to establish compliance with such other rule made by that regulator as may be specified. 3 A rule may include the provision mentioned in subsection (1) only if the regulator making the rule considers that it is appropriate for it also to include the provision required by subsection (2). 4 In this section  \u201c rule \u201d does not include a rule made under\u2014 a section 137O (threshold condition code); b section 192J (provision of information by parent undertakings). Actions for damages 138D 1 A rule made by the PRA may provide that contravention of the rule is actionable at the suit of a private person who suffers loss as a result of the contravention, subject to the defences and other incidents applying to actions for breach of statutory duty. 2 A contravention by an authorised person of a rule made by the FCA is actionable at the suit of a private person who suffers loss as a result of the contravention, subject to the defences and other incidents applying to actions for breach of statutory duty. 3 If rules made by the FCA so provide, subsection (2) does not apply to a contravention of a specified provision of the rules. 4 In prescribed cases, a contravention of a rule which by virtue of subsection (1) or (2) would be actionable at the suit of a private person is actionable at the suit of a person who is not a private person, subject to the defences and other incidents applying to actions for breach of statutory duty. 5 In subsections (1), (2) and (3)  \u201c rule \u201d does not include\u2014 a Part 6 rules; b rules under section 137O (threshold condition code); c rules under section 192J (provision of information by parent undertakings); d a rule requiring an authorised person to have or maintain financial resources. 6 \u201cPrivate person\u201d has such meaning as may be prescribed. Limits on effect of contravening rules 138E 1 A person is not guilty of an offence by reason of a contravention of a rule made by either regulator. 2 No such contravention makes any transaction void or unenforceable. 3 Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to\u2014 a rules made by the FCA under section 137C, or b product intervention rules made by the FCA under section 137D. Procedural provisions Notification of rules 138F If either regulator makes, alters or revokes any rules, that regulator must without delay give written notice\u2014 a to the Treasury, and b to the Bank of England. Rule-making instruments 138G 1 Any power conferred on either regulator to make rules is exercisable in writing. 2 An instrument by which rules are made by either regulator (\u201ca rule-making instrument\u201d) must specify the provision under which the rules are made. 3 To the extent that a rule-making instrument does not comply with subsection (2), it is void. 4 A rule-making instrument must be published by the regulator making the rule in the way appearing to that regulator to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public. 5 The regulator making the rule may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a copy of a rule-making instrument. 6 A person is not to be taken to have contravened any rule made by a regulator if the person shows that at the time of the alleged contravention the rule-making instrument concerned had not been made available in accordance with this section. Verification of rules 138H 1 The production of a printed copy of a rule-making instrument purporting to be made by a regulator\u2014 a on which is endorsed a certificate signed by a member of staff of that regulator who is authorised by the regulator for that purpose, and b which contains the required statements, is evidence (or in Scotland sufficient evidence) of the facts stated in the certificate. 2 The required statements are\u2014 a that the instrument was made by the FCA or the PRA (as the case may be), b that the copy is a true copy of the instrument, and c that on a specified date the instrument was made available to the public in accordance with section 138G(4). 3 A certificate purporting to be signed as mentioned in subsection (1) is to be taken to have been properly signed unless the contrary is shown. 4 A person who wishes in any legal proceedings to rely on a rule-making instrument may require the regulator that made the rule to endorse a copy of the instrument with a certificate of the kind mentioned in subsection (1). Consultation by the FCA 138I 1 Before making any rules, the FCA must\u2014 a consult the PRA, and b after doing so, publish a draft of the proposed rules in the way appearing to the FCA to be best calculated to bring them to the attention of the public. 2 The draft must be accompanied by\u2014 a a cost benefit analysis, b an explanation of the purpose of the proposed rules, c any statement prepared under section 138K(2), d an explanation of the FCA's reasons for believing that making the proposed rules is compatible with its duties under section 1B(1) and (5)(a), and e notice that representations about the proposals may be made to the FCA within a specified time. 3 Before making the proposed rules, the FCA must have regard to any representations made to it in accordance with subsection (2)(e). 4 If the FCA makes the proposed rules, it must publish an account, in general terms, of\u2014 a the representations made to it in accordance with subsection (2)(e), and b its response to them. 5 If the rules differ from the draft published under subsection (1)(b) in a way which is, in the opinion of the FCA, significant the FCA must publish\u2014 a details of the difference (in addition to complying with subsection (4)) together with a cost benefit analysis, and b any statement prepared under section 138K(4). 6 The requirements to carry out a cost benefit analysis under this section do not apply in relation to rules made under\u2014 a section 136(2); b subsection (1) of section 213 as a result of subsection (4) of that section; c section 234; d paragraph 23 of Schedule 1ZA; e paragraph 12 of Schedule 1A. 7 \u201c Cost benefit analysis \u201d means\u2014 a an analysis of the costs together with an analysis of the benefits that will arise\u2014 i if the proposed rules are made, or ii if subsection (5) applies, from the rules that have been made, and b subject to subsection (8), an estimate of those costs and of those benefits. 8 If, in the opinion of the FCA\u2014 a the costs or benefits referred to in subsection (7) cannot reasonably be estimated, or b it is not reasonably practicable to produce an estimate, the cost benefit analysis need not estimate them, but must include a statement of the FCA's opinion and an explanation of it. 9 The FCA may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a copy of a draft published under subsection (1)(b). 10 Subsection (1)(a) does not apply to rules made by the FCA in relation to recognised investment exchanges under Part 18. 11 This section is subject to section 138L.

CHAPTER 4 Competition scrutiny Interpretation 140A 1 In this Chapter\u2014 \u201c market in the United Kingdom \u201d includes\u2014 so far as it operates in the United Kingdom or a part of the United Kingdom, any market which operates there and in another country or territory or in a part of another country or territory, and any market which operates only in a part of the United Kingdom; \u201c the  OFT \u201d means the Office of Fair Trading; \u201c practices \u201d, in relation to each regulator, means practices adopted by that regulator in the exercise of functions under this Act; \u201c regulating provisions \u201d means\u2014 in relation to the FCA, any\u2014 rules of the FCA; general guidance (as defined by section 139B(5)); statement issued by the FCA under section 64; code issued by the FCA under section 64 or 119; in relation to the PRA, any\u2014 rules of the PRA; statement issued by the PRA under section 64; code issued by the PRA under section 64. 2 In this Chapter each of the Competition Commission and the OFT is  \u201ca competition authority\u201d. 3 For the purposes of this Chapter, any reference to a feature of a market in the United Kingdom for goods or services is to be read as a reference to\u2014 a the structure of the market concerned or any aspect of that structure, b any conduct (whether or not in the market concerned) of one or more than one person who supplies or acquires goods or services in the market concerned, or c any conduct relating to the market concerned of customers of any person who supplies or acquires goods or services. 4 In subsection (3)  \u201c conduct \u201d includes any failure to act (whether or not intentional) and any other unintentional conduct. Advice about effect of regulating provision or practice 140B 1 In this Chapter, any reference to the giving of  \u201csection 140B advice\u201d to a regulator is to be read in accordance with this section. 2 The OFT gives  \u201csection 140B advice\u201d to a regulator if\u2014 a it gives advice to the regulator under section 7 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (provision of competition advice to Ministers etc.), and b the advice states that in the opinion of the OFT one or more of the things mentioned in subsection (4) may cause, or contribute to, the effect mentioned in subsection (5), or might be expected to do so in the future. 3 The Competition Commission gives  \u201csection 140B advice\u201d to a regulator if a report published by it under section 136 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (investigations and reports on market investigation reference) contains\u2014 a a decision that one or more of the things mentioned in subsection (4) may cause, or contribute to, the effect mentioned in subsection (5), and b a recommendation that any action should be taken by that regulator. 4 Those things are\u2014 a a regulating provision or practice of the regulator, b two or more regulating provisions or practices (of that regulator or of both regulators) taken together, c a particular combination of regulating provision or practices (of that regulator or of both regulators), or d a feature, or combination of features, of a market in the United Kingdom that could be dealt with by regulating provision or practices (of that regulator or of both regulators). 5 That effect is the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in connection with the supply or acquisition of any goods or services in the United Kingdom or a part of the United Kingdom. Consultation with regulator 140C Before giving section 140B advice, a competition authority must consult the regulator to which the advice is to be given. Investigation powers of OFT 140D Where the OFT is deciding whether to exercise its power under section 7 of the Enterprise Act 2002 to give advice which, if given, would be section 140B advice, section 174 of that Act has effect as if\u2014 a in subsection (1), for the words from  \u201cmake a reference\u201d to the end there were substituted  \u201c                                  give advice which would for the purposes of Chapter 4 of Part 9A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 be section 140B advice                                \u201d , and b in subsection (2), for  \u201cmake such a reference\u201d there were substituted  \u201c                                  give such advice                                \u201d . Publication by OFT of section 140B advice 140E The OFT must publish in such manner as it thinks fit any section 140B advice given by it to either regulator. Duty of Competition Commission to send report to regulator 140F 1 Where the publication of a report of the Competition Commission under section 142 of the Enterprise Act 2002 constitutes the giving of section 140B advice to either regulator, the Commission must give a copy of the report to that regulator. 2 The day on which the copy is given is the day on which the regulator is to be taken to receive the section 140B advice. Duty of regulator to publish response 140G 1 A regulator must, within 90 days after the day on which it receives section 140B advice, publish a response stating how it proposes to deal with the advice and in particular\u2014 a whether it has decided to take any action, or to take no action, in response to the advice, b if it has decided to take action, what action it proposes to take, and c its reasons for its proposals. 2 Publication is to be in such manner as the regulator thinks fit. Role of the Treasury 140H 1 This section applies where\u2014 a a competition authority has given section 140B advice and the regulator has published a response under section 140G, and b the competition authority remains of the opinion that one or more of the things mentioned in section 140B(4) may cause or contribute to, the effect mentioned in section 140B(5). 2 The competition authority may refer the section 140B advice to the Treasury by sending the Treasury\u2014 a a copy of the section 140B advice and of the response, and b a request to consider the advice and the response. 3 In referring the section 140B advice, the competition authority may give advice to the Treasury as to what action, if any, ought to be taken by the regulator. 4 If section 140B advice is referred to them, the Treasury may give a direction to the regulator to which the advice was given requiring the regulator to take such action as may be specified in the direction. 5 In considering whether to give a direction and, if so, what action to specify, the Treasury must have regard to\u2014 a any advice the competition authority has given under subsection (3), b any action which the section 140B advice suggests that the regulator should take, and c the response of the regulator to the section 140B advice. 6 The direction may not require the regulator to do anything that it has no power to do, but the existence of the direction is relevant to the exercise of any discretion conferred on the regulator. 7 Before giving a direction under this section, the Treasury must consult the regulator to which it is to be given. 8 If the Treasury give a direction under this section they must\u2014 a publish in such manner as they think fit a statement giving details of the direction and of their reasons for giving it, and b lay a copy of the statement before Parliament. CHAPTER 5 Power to make consequential amendments Power to make consequential amendments of references to rules etc. 141A 1 This section applies if\u2014 a a provision of primary or subordinate legislation (whenever passed or made) contains a reference (however expressed) to rules of either regulator or to guidance of the FCA, b it appears to the Treasury or the Secretary of State that the reference requires amendment in consequence of the exercise by that regulator of its power under this Part to make, alter or revoke its rules or the exercise by the FCA of its power to make, alter or revoke its guidance. 2 The Treasury or the Secretary of State may by order make such amendment of the legislation referred to in subsection (1)(a) as appears to them to be necessary or expedient in consequence of the exercise by the regulator of the power mentioned in subsection (1)(b). 3 The power conferred by subsection (2) includes power\u2014 a to replace a reference to the rules of one regulator with a reference to the rules of the other regulator or to the rules of both regulators; b to replace a reference to the rules of both regulators with a reference to the rules of one regulator. 4 In subsection (1)(a)  \u201c subordinate legislation \u201d does not include rules of either regulator. 2 In section 391 of FSMA 2000 (publication), after subsection (5) insert\u2014 5A Subsection (5) does not apply in relation to a notice given in accordance with section 137S(5) or (8)(a) (but see section 137S(11)). 3 In section 395 of FSMA 2000 (procedures in relation to giving of supervisory notices etc), in subsection (13), after paragraph (bb) insert\u2014 bba section 137S(5) or (8)(a); . 4 Omit Schedule 14 to FSMA 2000 (role of the Competition Commission)."}, {"act": "Financial Services Act 2012", "year": 2012, "section": "25", "section_title": "Functions relating to short selling", "section_text": "25 1 In every provision of Part 8A of FSMA 2000 (short selling) for  \u201cAuthority\u201d or \u201cAuthority's\u201d in each place substitute  \u201c                    FCA                  \u201d  or \u201cFCA's\u201d. 2 Subsection (1) does not affect references to  \u201cthe competent authority\u201d."}, {"act": "Financial Services Act 2012", "year": 2012, "section": "26", "section_title": "Control over authorised persons", "section_text": "26 1 FSMA 2000 is amended as follows. 2 In every provision of Part 12 (control over authorised persons), for  \u201cAuthority\u201d or \u201cAuthority's\u201d, in each place (where not expressly amended by the following provisions), substitute  \u201c                    appropriate regulator                  \u201d  or \u201cappropriate regulator's\u201d. 3 In section 178 (obligation to notify an acquisition of control), after subsection (2) insert\u2014 2A In this Part,  \u201c the appropriate regulator \u201d means\u2014 a where the UK authorised person is a PRA-authorised person, the PRA; b in any other case, the FCA. 4 In section 179 (requirements for section 178 notices) in subsection (2), for  \u201cThe Authority\u201d substitute  \u201c                    Each regulator                  \u201d . 5 In section 187 (approval with conditions), for subsection (2) substitute\u2014 2 The appropriate regulator may only impose conditions where\u2014 a if it did not impose those conditions, it would propose to object to the acquisition, or b it is required to do so by a direction under section 187A(3)(b) or section 187B(3). 6 After section 187 insert\u2014 Assessment: consultation by PRA with FCA 187A 1 The PRA must consult the FCA before acting under section 185. 2 The FCA may make representations to the PRA in relation to any of the matters set out in sections 185(2) and 186. 3 If the FCA considers that on the basis of the matters set out in section 186(f) there are reasonable grounds to object to the acquisition, the FCA may\u2014 a direct the PRA to object to the acquisition, or b direct the PRA not to approve the acquisition unless it does so subject to conditions specified in the direction (with or without other conditions). 4 Before giving a direction under subsection (3), the FCA must notify the PRA of its proposal to do so. 5 In order to comply with the obligation under subsection (1), the PRA must provide the FCA with\u2014 a copies of\u2014 i the section 178 notice, and ii any document included with that notice, b any further information provided pursuant to section 190, and c any other information in the possession of the PRA which\u2014 i in the opinion of the PRA, is relevant to the application, or ii is reasonably requested by the FCA. 6 If the PRA acts under section 185(1)(b), it must indicate to the section 178 notice-giver any representations or directions received from the FCA. 7 Directions given by the FCA under this section are subject to any directions given to the FCA under section 3I or 3J.

Meaning of  \u201cqualifying parent undertaking\u201d 192B 1 The parent undertaking of a qualifying authorised person or recognised UK investment exchange is for the purposes of this Part a  \u201cqualifying parent undertaking\u201d if the following conditions are satisfied in relation to it. 2 Condition A is that the parent undertaking is a body corporate which\u2014 a is incorporated in the United Kingdom, or b has a place of business in the United Kingdom. 3 Condition B is that the parent undertaking is not itself an authorised person, a recognised investment exchange or a recognised clearing house. 4 Condition C is that the parent undertaking is a financial institution of a kind prescribed by the Treasury by order. 5 \u201c Recognised UK investment exchange \u201d means a recognised investment exchange that is not an overseas investment exchange as defined in section 313(1). 6 The Treasury may by order\u2014 a amend subsection (4) by omitting the words  \u201ca financial institution\u201d, and b make any amendment of subsection (2) that they consider desirable in connection with an amendment made under paragraph (a). Power of direction Power to direct qualifying parent undertaking 192C 1 The appropriate regulator may give a direction under this section to a qualifying parent undertaking if either the general condition or the consolidated supervision condition is satisfied. 2 The general condition is that the appropriate regulator considers that it is desirable to give the direction in order to advance\u2014 a in the case of the FCA, one or more of its operational objectives; b in the case of the PRA, any of its objectives. 3 The consolidated supervision condition is that\u2014 a the appropriate regulator is the competent authority for the purpose of consolidated supervision that is required, in relation to some or all of the members of the group of a qualifying authorised person, in pursuance of any of the directives mentioned in section 3M(3), and b the appropriate regulator considers that the giving of the direction is desirable for the purpose of the effective consolidated supervision of the group. 4 In subsection (3)(a)  \u201c consolidated supervision \u201d includes supplemental supervision. 5 In deciding whether to give a direction under this section, a regulator must have regard\u2014 a to the desirability where practicable of exercising its powers in relation to authorised persons or recognised investment exchanges rather than its powers under this section, and b to the principle that a burden or restriction which is imposed on a person should be proportionate to the benefits, considered in general terms, which are expected to result from its imposition. 6 \u201c The appropriate regulator \u201d means\u2014 a where a direction relates to a qualifying authorised person or recognised investment exchange who is a PRA-authorised person, the FCA or the PRA; b in any other case, the FCA. Requirements that may be imposed 192D 1 A direction under section 192C may require the parent undertaking\u2014 a to take specified action, or b to refrain from taking specified action. 2 A requirement may be imposed by reference to the parent undertaking's relationship with\u2014 a its group, or b other members of its group. 3 A requirement may refer to the past conduct of the parent undertaking (for example, by requiring the parent undertaking to review or take remedial action in respect of past conduct). 4 A requirement imposed by the direction may be expressed to expire at the end of a specified period, but the imposition of a requirement that expires at the end of a specified period does not affect the power to give a further direction imposing a new requirement. 5 The direction\u2014 a may be revoked by the regulator which gave it by written notice to the body to which it is given, and b ceases to be in force if the body to which it is given ceases to be a qualifying parent undertaking. Direction: procedure 192E 1 If a regulator proposes to give a direction under section 192C, or gives such a direction with immediate effect, it must give written notice to\u2014 a the parent undertaking to which the direction is given (or to be given) (\u201cP\u201d), and b any authorised person or recognised investment exchange who will, in the opinion of the regulator, be significantly affected by the direction. 2 In the following provisions of this section  \u201c notified person \u201d means a person to whom notice under subsection (1) is given. 3 A direction under section 192C takes effect\u2014 a immediately, if the notice under subsection (1) states that that is the case, b on such other date as may be specified in the notice, or c if no date is specified in the notice, when the matter to which the notice relates is no longer open to review. 4 A direction may be expressed to take effect immediately (or on a specified date) only if the regulator reasonably considers that it is necessary for the direction to take effect immediately (or on that date). 5 The notice under subsection (1) must\u2014 a give details of the direction, b state the regulator's reasons for the direction and for its determination as to when the direction takes effect, c inform the notified person that the person may make representations to the regulator within such period as may be specified in the notice (whether or not the notified person has referred the matter to the Tribunal), and d inform the notified person of the person's right to refer the matter to the Tribunal. 6 The regulator may extend the period allowed under the notice for making representations. 7 If, having considered any representations made by any notified person, the regulator decides\u2014 a to give the direction proposed, or b if the direction has been given, not to revoke the direction, it must give each of the notified persons written notice. 8 If, having considered any representations made by any notified person, the regulator decides\u2014 a not to give the direction proposed, b to give a different direction, or c to revoke a direction which has effect, it must give each of the notified persons written notice. 9 A notice given under subsection (7) must inform the notified person of the person's right to refer the matter to the Tribunal. 10 A notice under subsection (8)(b) must comply with subsection (5). 11 If a notice informs the notified person of the person's right to refer a matter to the Tribunal, it must give an indication of the procedure on such a reference. 12 For the purposes of subsection (3)(c), whether a matter is open to review is to be determined in accordance with section 391(8). Consultation between regulators 192F 1 Before the PRA gives a notice under section 192E(1) or (8)(b), it must consult the FCA. 2 Before the FCA gives a notice under section 192E(1) or (8)(b) in relation to the parent undertaking of a PRA-authorised person, the FCA must consult the PRA. 3 Before either regulator gives a notice under section 192E(1) or (8)(b) in relation to the parent undertaking of a recognised clearing house, the regulator must consult the Bank of England. References to Tribunal 192G 1 A notified person who is aggrieved by the exercise by either regulator of its powers in relation to directions under section 192C may refer the matter to the Tribunal. 2 \u201c Notified person \u201d is to be read in accordance with subsection (2) of section 192E, except that it includes a person to whom a notice under subsection (1) of that section ought to have been given. Statement of policy: directions under section 192C 192H 1 Each regulator must prepare and issue a statement of policy with respect to the giving of directions under section 192C. 2 A regulator may at any time alter or replace a statement issued under this section. 3 If a statement issued under this section is altered or replaced, the regulator must issue the altered or replacement statement. 4 In exercising or deciding whether to exercise its power under section 192C in any particular case, a regulator must have regard to any statement published under this section and for the time being in force. 5 A statement under this section must be published by the regulator concerned in the way appearing to the regulator to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public. 6 A regulator may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a copy of a statement published under this section. 7 A regulator must, without delay, give the Treasury a copy of any statement which the regulator publishes under this section. Statement of policy relating to directions: procedure 192I 1 Before issuing a statement of policy under section 192H, a regulator (\u201cthe issuing regulator\u201d) must\u2014 a consult the other regulator and the Bank of England, and b publish a draft of the proposed statement in the way appearing to the issuing regulator to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public. 2 The draft must be accompanied by notice that representations about the proposal may be made to the issuing regulator within a specified time. 3 Before issuing the proposed statement, the issuing regulator must have regard to any representations made to it in accordance with subsection (2). 4 If the issuing regulator issues the proposed statement it must publish an account, in general terms, of\u2014 a the representations made to it in accordance with subsection (2), and b its response to them. 5 If the statement differs from the draft published under subsection (2) in a way which is, in the opinion of the issuing regulator, significant, the issuing regulator\u2014 a must before issuing it consult the other regulator again, and b must (in addition to complying with subsection (4)), publish details of the difference. 6 The issuing regulator may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a draft published under subsection (1)(b). 7 This section also applies to a proposal to alter or replace a statement. Rules requiring provision of information by parent undertakings Rules requiring provision of information by parent undertakings 192J 1 The appropriate regulator may make rules requiring qualifying parent undertakings\u2014 a to provide to the regulator information of a specified description; b to produce to the regulator documents of a specified description. 2 The rules may only specify a description of information or documents that is relevant to the exercise by the regulator of its functions. 3 The rules may make provision\u2014 a as to the time within which information must be provided or documents produced; b about the form in which any information is to provided; c about the place where any documents are to be produced; d requiring information provided to be verified in a specified manner; e requiring documents produced to be authenticated in a specified manner. 4 \u201c The appropriate regulator \u201d means\u2014 a in relation to the parent undertaking of a qualifying authorised person who is a PRA-authorised person, the FCA or the PRA; b in any other case, the FCA. Failure to comply with direction or breach of rules Power to impose penalty or issue censure 192K 1 This section applies if a regulator is satisfied that a person who is or has been a qualifying parent undertaking (\u201cP\u201d) has contravened\u2014 a a requirement of a direction given to P by that regulator under section 192C, or b a provision of rules made by that regulator under section 192J. 2 The regulator may impose a penalty of such amount as it considers appropriate on\u2014 a P, or b any person who was knowingly concerned in the contravention. 3 The regulator may, instead of imposing a penalty on a person, publish a statement censuring the person. 4 The regulator may not take action against a person under this section after the end of the limitation period unless, before the end of that period, it has given a warning notice to the person under section 192L. 5 \u201c The limitation period \u201d means the period of 3 years beginning with the first day on which the regulator knew of the contravention. 6 For this purpose a regulator is to be treated as knowing of a contravention if it has information from which the contravention can reasonably be inferred. Procedure and right to refer to Tribunal 192L 1 If a regulator proposes to take action against a person under section 192K, it must give the person a warning notice. 2 A warning notice about a proposal to impose a penalty must state the amount of the penalty. 3 A warning notice about a proposal to publish a statement must set out the terms of the statement. 4 If the regulator decides to take action against a person under section 192K, it must give the person a decision notice. 5 A decision notice about the imposition of a penalty must state the amount of the penalty. 6 A decision notice about the publication of a statement must set out the terms of the statement. 7 If the regulator decides to take action against a person under section 192K, the person may refer the matter to the Tribunal. Duty on publication of statement 192M After a statement under section 192K(3) is published, the regulator must send a copy of the statement to\u2014 a the person in respect of whom it is made, and b any person to whom a copy of the decision notice was given under section 393(4). Imposition of penalties under section 192K: statement of policy 192N 1 Each regulator must prepare and issue a statement of policy with respect to\u2014 a the imposition of penalties under section 192K, and b the amount of penalties under that section. 2 A regulator's policy in determining what the amount of a penalty should be must include having regard to\u2014 a the seriousness of the contravention, b the extent to which the contravention was deliberate or reckless, and c whether the person on whom the penalty is to be imposed is an individual. 3 A regulator may at any time alter or replace a statement issued under this section. 4 If a statement issued under this section is altered or replaced, the regulator must issue the altered or replacement statement. 5 In exercising, or deciding whether to exercise, a power under section 192K(2) in the case of any particular contravention, a regulator must have regard to any statement of policy published under this section and in force at a time when the contravention occurred. 6 A statement under this section must be published by the regulator concerned in the way appearing to the regulator to be best calculated to bring it to the attention of the public. 7 A regulator may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a copy of the statement published under this section. 8 A regulator must, without delay, give the Treasury a copy of any statement which it publishes under this section. 9 Section 192I applies in relation to a statement under this section as it applies in relation to a statement under section
