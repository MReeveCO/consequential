The meaning here of  \u201cincome\u201d is given by section 74. Step 2  Calculate the BLAGAB chargeable gains of the company for the accounting period as adjusted for allowable losses (see section 75). Step 3  Calculate so much of the amount (or the total amount) of any I - E receipt under section 92 or 93(5)(a) as is not taken into account in the calculation required by step 1 or 2.

Section 74A: supplementary provision 74B 1 A transfer of value arising by virtue of section 74A is to be taken to be a transfer which is not a potentially exempt transfer. 2 For the purposes of section 74A\u2014 a when determining the value transferred by a transfer of value arising by virtue of that section, no account is to be taken of section 3(2), b nothing in section 10(1) applies to prevent such a transfer, and c nothing in sections 102 to 102C of the Finance Act 1986 applies in relation to such a transfer. 3 Where, ignoring this subsection, a transfer of value would arise by virtue of section 74A (\u201cthe current transfer\u201d), the value transferred by a relevant related transfer is to be treated as reducing the value transferred by the current transfer. But this subsection does not apply if and to the extent that the relevant related transfer has already been applied to reduce another transfer of value arising by virtue of that section. 4 \u201c Relevant related transfer \u201d means\u2014 a where the arrangements consist of a series of operations, any transfer of value constituted by one or more of those operations which occur before or at the same time as the current transfer, other than a transfer of value arising by virtue of section 74A, and b where the arrangements consist of a single operation, any transfer of value which arises from that operation, other than a transfer of value arising by virtue of section 74A. 5 Section 268(3) does not apply to a transfer of value arising by virtue of section 74A. 6 Where\u2014 a a transfer of value has arisen by virtue of section 74A, b in the course of the arrangements the individual acquires an interest in possession in settled property, and c section 5(1B) applies to the interest in possession so that it forms part of the individual's estate, this Act has effect as if that transfer of value had never arisen. Interpretation of sections 74A and 74B 74C 1 Subsections (2) to (4) have effect for the purposes of sections 74A and 74B. 2 An individual has an interest in property comprised in a settlement if\u2014 a the property, or any derived property, is or will or may become payable to, or applicable for the benefit of\u2014 i the individual, ii the individual's spouse or civil partner, or iii a close company in relation to which the individual or the individual's spouse or civil partner is a participator or a company which is a 51% subsidiary of such a close company, in any circumstances whatsoever, or b a person within sub-paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (a) enjoys a benefit deriving (directly or indirectly) from the property or any derived property. 3 A  \u201crelevant reduction\u201d in the value of the individual's estate occurs\u2014 a if and when the value of the individual's estate first becomes less than it would have been in the absence of the arrangements, and b on each subsequent occasion when the value of that estate becomes less than it would have been in the absence of the arrangements and that difference in value is greater than the sum of any previous relevant reductions. 4 The amount of a relevant reduction is\u2014 a in the case of a reduction within subsection (3)(a), the difference between the value of the estate and its value in the absence of the arrangements, and b in the case of a reduction within subsection (3)(b), the amount by which the difference in value mentioned in that provision exceeds the sum of any previous relevant reductions. 5 In sections 74A and 74B and this section\u2014 \u201c arrangements \u201d includes any scheme, transaction or series of transactions, agreement or understanding, whether or not legally enforceable, and any associated operations; \u201c close company \u201d has the meaning given in section 102; \u201c derived property \u201d, in relation to any property, means\u2014 income from that property, property directly or indirectly representing\u2014 proceeds of that property, or proceeds of income from that property, or income from property which is derived property by virtue of paragraph (b); \u201c operation \u201d includes an omission; \u201c participator \u201d has the meaning given in section 102; \u201c the relevant time \u201d means\u2014 the time the relevant reduction occurs, or if later, the time section 74A first applied; \u201c 51% subsidiary \u201d has the same meaning as in the Corporation Tax Acts (see Chapter 3 of Part 24 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010). 4 In section 201 (liability for tax: settled property), after subsection (4) insert\u2014 4A Where\u2014 a a charge to tax arises under or by virtue of section 74A, or b in a case where paragraphs (a) to (d) of section 74A are satisfied, a charge to tax arises under section 64 or 65 in respect of the relevant settled property (within the meaning of section 74A), subsection (1) of
