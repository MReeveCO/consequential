to harassment of the other person. 3 The following are examples of acts or omissions which, in particular circumstances, are ones associated with stalking\u2014 a following a person, b contacting, or attempting to contact, a person by any means, c publishing any statement or other material\u2014 i relating or purporting to relate to a person, or ii purporting to originate from a person, d monitoring the use by a person of the internet, email or any other form of electronic communication, e loitering in any place (whether public or private), f interfering with any property in the possession of a person, g watching or spying on a person. 4 A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 51 weeks, or a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or both. 5 In relation to an offence committed before the commencement of section 281(5) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the reference in subsection (4) to 51 weeks is to be read as a reference to six months. 6 This section is without prejudice to the generality of section 2. 2 After section 4 of that Act (putting people in fear of violence) insert\u2014 Stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress 4A 1 A person (\u201cA\u201d) whose course of conduct\u2014 a amounts to stalking, and b either\u2014 i causes another (\u201cB\u201d) to fear, on at least two occasions, that violence will be used against B, or ii causes B serious alarm or distress which has a substantial adverse effect on B's usual day-to-day activities, is guilty of an offence if A knows or ought to know that A's course of conduct will cause B so to fear on each of those occasions or (as the case may be) will cause such alarm or distress. 2 For the purposes of this section A ought to know that A's course of conduct will cause B to fear that violence will be used against B on any occasion if a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think the course of conduct would cause B so to fear on that occasion. 3 For the purposes of this section A ought to know that A's course of conduct will cause B serious alarm or distress which has a substantial adverse effect on B's usual day-to-day activities if a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think the course of conduct would cause B such alarm or distress. 4 It is a defence for A to show that\u2014 a A's course of conduct was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime, b A's course of conduct was pursued under any enactment or rule of law or to comply with any condition or requirement imposed by any person under any enactment, or c the pursuit of A's course of conduct was reasonable for the protection of A or another or for the protection of A's or another's property. 5 A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable\u2014 a on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or a fine, or both, or b on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or both. 6 In relation to an offence committed before the commencement of section 154(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the reference in subsection (5)(b) to twelve months is to be read as a reference to six months. 7 If on the trial on indictment of a person charged with an offence under this section the jury find the person not guilty of the offence charged, they may find the person guilty of an offence under section 2 or 2A. 8 The Crown Court has the same powers and duties in relation to a person who is by virtue of subsection (7) convicted before it of an offence under section 2 or 2A as a magistrates' court would have on convicting the person of the offence. 9 This section is without prejudice to the generality of section 4."}, {"act": "Protection of Freedoms Act 2012", "year": 2012, "section": "112", "section_title":
