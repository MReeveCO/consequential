centre, c a young offender institution, and d accommodation, or accommodation of a description, for the time being specified by   regulations under section 248(1)(f) of the Sentencing Code   (youth

court that it is of the opinion mentioned in section 98(4), 99(7), 100(4) or 101(7)              (as the case may be), and b explain to the child in open court and in ordinary language why it is of

(arrangements for remands), and c section 104 (looked after child status). 7 That authority must be\u2014 a in the case of a child who is being looked after by a local authority   otherwise than by virtue of section 104(1) , that authority, and b in any other case   but subject to subsection (7B), a local authority  in whose area it appears to the court that the child habitually resides or the offence or one of the offences was committed. 7A In a case to which subsection (7)(b) applies, the court is to designate a local authority in whose area it appears to the court that the child habitually resides (a  \u201chome authority\u201d) except where the court\u2014 a considers as respects the home authority, or each home authority, that it is inappropriate to designate that

jurisdiction to make a replacement designation under subsection (7C) in connection with one or some of the remands also has jurisdiction to make such a replacement designation in connection with each of the other remands. 7E Where a replacement designation is made under subsection (7C) after the end of the period of remand concerned, the substitution of B for the previously-designated authority

previously-designated authority\u2014 a has effect, as respects the part of that period ending with the making of the replacement designation, only for the purposes of regulations under section 103, and b has effect, as respects the remainder of that period, for all of the purposes listed in subsection (6). 7G A court may make a replacement designation under subsection (7C) only if it considers that, had everything it knows been known by the court which made the previous designation, that court would have designated B instead. 7H Where a replacement designation is made under subsection (7C) in relation to a remand, the previously-designated authority is to be repaid any sums it paid in respect of the remand pursuant to regulations under section 103. 7J A court which has jurisdiction to

part of the sentence. But this is subject to subsections (4) to (6). 4 If, on any day on which the offender was remanded in custody, the offender was also detained in connection with any other matter, that day is not to count as time served. 5 A day counts as time served\u2014 a in relation to only one sentence, and b only once in relation to that sentence. 6 A day is not to count as time served as part of any period of 28 days served by the offender before automatic release (see section 255B(1)). 7 For the purposes of this section a suspended sentence\u2014 a is to be treated as a sentence of imprisonment when it takes effect under paragraph 8(2)(a) or (b) of Schedule 12, and b is to be treated as being imposed by the order under which it takes effect. 8 In this section  \u201c related offence \u201d means an offence, other than the offence for which the sentence is imposed (\u201coffence A\u201d), with which the offender was charged and the charge for which was founded on the same facts or evidence as offence A. 9 For the purposes of the references in subsections (3) and (5) to the term of imprisonment to which a person has been sentenced (that is to say, the reference to the offender's  \u201csentence\u201d), consecutive terms and terms which are wholly or partly concurrent are to be treated as a single term if\u2014 a the sentences were passed on the same occasion, or b where they were passed on different occasions, the person has not been released at any time during the period beginning with the first and ending with the last of those occasions. 10 The reference in subsection (4) to detention in connection with any other matter does not include remand in custody in connection with another offence but includes\u2014 a detention pursuant to any custodial sentence; b committal in default of payment of any sum of money; c committal for want of sufficient distress to satisfy any sum of money; d committal for failure to do or abstain from doing anything required to be done or left undone. 11 This section applies to a determinate sentence of detention under section 91 or 96 of the Sentencing Act or section 227 or 228 of this Act as it applies to an equivalent sentence of imprisonment."}, {"act": "Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012", "year": 2012, "section": "109", "section_title": "Crediting of periods of remand on bail", "section_text": "109 1 Section 240A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (crediting periods of remand on bail: terms of imprisonment and detention) is amended as follows. 2 In subsection (2), for  \u201csubsection (4)\u201d substitute  \u201c                      subsections (3A) and (3B)                    \u201d . 3 For subsections (3) to (7) substitute\u2014 3 The credit period is calculated by taking the following steps.
