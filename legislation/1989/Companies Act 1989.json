any property representing property so acquired, b any property representing income which has accrued before the alteration is made, or c the income from any such property as aforesaid. 3   Sections 39 and 40 of the Companies Act 2006 (company\u2019s capacity and power of directors to bind company)   do not apply to the acts of a company which is a charity except in favour of a person who\u2014 a

property, the fact that the act was not permitted by the company\u2019s   constitution   or, as the case may be, that the directors in connection with the act exceeded any limitation on their powers under the company\u2019s constitution, does not affect the title of a person who subsequently acquires the property or any interest in it for full consideration without actual notice of any such circumstances affecting the validity of the company\u2019s act. 5 In any proceedings arising out of subsection (3) the burden of proving\u2014 a that a person knew that an act was not permitted by the

subsection (6)(d) \u201c conveyance \u201d means any document for the creation, transfer, variation or extinction of an interest in land. 8 If a company fails to comply with subsection (6) it commits an offence. 9 An officer of a company, or a person acting on its behalf, who\u2014 a issues or authorises the issue of any business letter of the company, or any notice or other official publication of the company, in which the statement required by subsection (6) does not appear, or b issues or authorises the issue of any bill, invoice, receipt or letter of credit in which the statement required
