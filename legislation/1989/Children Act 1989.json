b his physical, emotional and educational needs; c the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances; d his age, sex, background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant; e any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering; f how capable each of his parents, and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting his needs;

or b the court is considering whether to make, vary or discharge  a special guardianship order or  an order under Part IV. 5 Where a court is considering whether or not to make one or more orders under this Act with respect to a child, it shall not make the order or any of the orders unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all. 6 In subsection (2A)  \u201c parent \u201d means parent of the child concerned; and, for the purposes of that subsection, a parent of the child concerned\u2014 a is within this paragraph if that parent can be involved in the child's life in a way that does not put the child at risk of suffering harm; and b is to be treated as being within paragraph (a) unless there is some evidence before the court in the particular proceedings to suggest that involvement of that parent in the child's life would put the child at risk of suffering harm whatever the form of the involvement. 7 The circumstances referred to are that the court is considering whether to make an order under section 4(1)(c) or (2A) or 4ZA(1)(c) or (5) (parental responsibility of parent other than mother)."}, {"act": "Children Act 1989", "year": 1989, "section": "2", "section_title": " Parental responsibility for children.", "section_text": "2 1 Where a child\u2019s father and mother were married to  , or civil partners of,   each other at the time of his birth, they shall each have parental responsibility for the child. 1A Where a child\u2014 a has a parent by virtue of section 42 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008;
