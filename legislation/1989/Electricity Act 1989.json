the potential contribution of electricity generated from each renewable source to the attainment of any target which relates to the generation of electricity or the production of energy and is imposed by, or results from or arises out of, an  EU  obligation. 5 For the purposes of subsection (4)(a), the costs associated with generating electricity from a renewable source include any costs associated with the production or supply of heat produced in connection with that generation. 6 For the purposes of subsection (4)(b), an operator's income associated with the generation of electricity from a renewable source includes any income connected with\u2014 a the acquisition of the renewable source; b the supply of heat produced in connection with the generation; c the disposal of any by-product of the generation process. 7 After the first order containing banding provision is made by the Secretary of State, no subsequent order containing such provision may be made by the Secretary of State
