In this section  \u201c county court limit \u201d means the county court limit for the time being specified in an Order in Council under  section 145 of the County Courts Act 1984  as the county court limit for the purposes of this section and  \u201c maintenance order \u201d has the same meaning as in section 2( a ) of the  Attachment of Earnings Act 1971. 3 An order under subsection (1) above is referred to in this Act as a \u201ccharging order\u201d. 4 Where a person applies to the High Court for a charging order to enforce more than one judgment or order, that court shall be the appropriate court in relation to the application if it would be the appropriate court, apart from this subsection, on an application relating to one or more of the judgments or orders concerned. 5 In deciding whether to make a charging order the court shall consider all the circumstances of the case and, in particular, any evidence before it as to\u2014 a the personal circumstances of the debtor, and b whether any other creditor of the debtor would be likely to be unduly prejudiced by the making of the order. 6 Subsections (7) and (8) apply where, under a judgment or order of the High Court   or the family court  or   the county court , a debtor is required to pay a sum of money by instalments. 7 The fact that there has been no default in payment of the instalments does not prevent a charging order from being made in respect of that sum. 8 But if there has been no default, the court must take that into account when considering the circumstances of the case under subsection (5). 9 In this section \u201cfamily proceedings\u201d means proceedings in the Family Division of the High Court which are business assigned, by or under section 61 of (and Schedule 1 to) the Senior Courts Act 1981,
