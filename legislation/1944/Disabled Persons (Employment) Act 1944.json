and b prohibited by its constitution from paying any dividend to its members. 3 The objects of any company to be formed for the purposes of this section may include all such objects as appear to the Minister to be requisite for enabling it to act effectively for those purposes, and any such company shall be constituted so as to enable all or any of its operations to be controlled by the Minister or persons acting on his behalf as may appear to the Minister to be requisite. 4 The Minister, or with his authorisation any such company association or body as aforesaid providing facilities under this section, may defray or contribute towards expenses incurred by persons for whom facilities are provided under this section in travelling to and from the place where they are employed or work or where training is provided, and may make payments to or in respect of such persons, up to such amounts as the Minister may with the approval of the Treasury determine and in such manner as he may determine. 5 Payments may be made by the Minister\u2014 a in respect of the expenses of the formation and incorporation of any such company as aforesaid b to any such company association or body as aforesaid in respect of expenses incurred by them in providing facilities under this section, or of expenses incurred by them under the last preceding subsection, and c to any local authority in respect of expenses incurred by them under any enactment conferring powers on them in that behalf in providing under arrangements made between the Minister and the authority facilities approved by him for any of the purposes mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, in defraying or contributing towards expenses incurred by persons for whom such facilities are so provided in travelling as mentioned in the last preceding subsection, or in making payments to or in respect of such persons, up to such amounts as the Minister may with the approval of the Treasury determine. 5A For the purposes of this section\u2014 a a person is a disabled person if he is a disabled person for the purposes of   the Equality Act 2010 ;
