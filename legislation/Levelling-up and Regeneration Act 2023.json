Duty to cooperate with independent expert   12D    1   This section applies where\u2014   a   a trigger event has occurred in relation to a local authority in England,     b   section 12C (2)  does not apply to prevent the power conferred by  section 12A (1)  being exercisable, in relation to that authority, by reason of that event, and     c   the Secretary of State has appointed an independent expert to review the level of the financial risk to the local authority.       2   The local authority must, so far as reasonably practicable, co-operate with the independent expert in any way that the independent expert considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of the conduct of the review.     3   In this section\u2014     \u201c financial risk \u201d has the same meaning as in  section 12A ;      \u201c independent expert \u201d means a person\u2014     who is independent of the local authority and the Secretary of State, and      who has relevant experience or knowledge which is relevant to the matter in question;         \u201c trigger event \u201d has the same meaning as in  section 12A .               3   In section 2 (control of borrowing), in subsection (1)\u2014   a   after paragraph (b) insert  \u201c, or\u201d , and     b   after that paragraph insert\u2014    c   any limit for the time being applicable to it under section 12A.          4   In section 5 (temporary borrowing)\u2014   a   in subsection (1), after \u201csection 4\u201d insert  \u201cor 12A\u201d , and     b   in subsection (2), after \u201csection 4(2)\u201d insert  \u201cor 12A\u201d .       5   In section 8 (control of credit arrangements), in subsection (1)\u2014   a   after paragraph (b) insert  \u201c, or\u201d , and     b   after that paragraph insert\u2014    c   any limit for the time being applicable to it under section 12A.          6   In section 12 (power to invest), at the end insert\u2014    This is subject to a direction under section 12A (risk-mitigation directions).       7   In section 19 (application to parish and community councils), in subsection (1) for \u201c9 to 13\u201d substitute  \u201c9 to 12, 13\u201d .     8   In section 23 (meaning of \u201c local authority \u201d in Chapter 3 of Part 1), in subsection (4), after \u201c1 to 8,\u201d insert  \u201c 12A  to  12D ,\u201d .

Amount of additional compensation   2    1   Additional compensation in respect of an acquisition is payable to an eligible person only if, in relation to that person, the alternative amount is greater than the original amount.     2   The amount payable is the difference between the two amounts.     3   The \u201coriginal amount\u201d is the amount of compensation awarded or agreed to be paid to the person in respect of the acquisition.     4   The \u201calternative amount\u201d is the amount of compensation that would have been assessed as due to the person in respect of the acquisition had compensation been assessed without the application of section  14A .     5   If the original amount was agreed, the relevant valuation date for the purposes of the assessment imagined under sub-paragraph  (4)  is the date on which the agreement was concluded.     6   In relation to the determination of an amount of additional compensation under this Schedule, section 17(2)(b) applies as if its reference to the amount of compensation were to the amount of additional compensation.     7   A certificate issued under section 17 (or 18) after the award or agreement referred to in sub-paragraph  (3)  is to have effect for the purposes of the assessment imagined under sub-paragraph  (4)  as if it had been issued before that assessment.     8   Any amount of compensation that is or would be attributable to disturbance, severance or injurious affection is to be ignored for the purposes of sub-paragraphs  (3)  and  (4) .        Time limit for application for direction   3   An application under paragraph  1 (2)  may not be made after the expiry of the period of 13 years beginning with the date on which the compulsory purchase order became operative.      Mortgages   4    1   For the purposes of this Schedule an \u201c eligible person \u201d includes a person who would have been entitled to compensation in respect of the acquisition but for the existence of a mortgage (but the mortgage is in that case still to be taken into account in determining the original and alternative amounts under paragraph  2 ).     2   An amount agreed or awarded to be paid to a mortgagee under section 15 or 16 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 in respect of the acquisition is to be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as compensation in respect of the acquisition.     3   The reference in sub-paragraph  (2)  to an amount paid under section 15 or 16 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (\u201cthe applicable section\u201d) includes an amount paid under section 52ZA or 52ZB of the Land Compensation Act 1973 and taken into account by virtue of section 52ZC(7)(d) of that Act for the purposes of the applicable section.     4   Additional compensation payable under this Schedule to a person in the person\u2019s capacity as a mortgagee (or to a person exercising rights of a mortgagee) is to be applied towards the discharge of the sums secured by the mortgage.     5   If there is no remaining sum secured by the mortgage, the additional compensation that would be payable as described in sub-paragraph  (4)  is instead payable to the person who is an eligible person by virtue of the interest that was subject to the mortgage.     6   If the additional compensation that would be payable as described in sub-paragraph  (4)  exceeds the total of the remaining sums secured by the mortgage, the amount of the excess is instead payable to the person who is an eligible person by virtue of the interest that was subject to the mortgage.        Successors-in-title   5    1   This paragraph applies if, had the compensation to which an eligible person was entitled in respect of the acquisition remained unpaid, the right to be paid it would now vest in some other person (assuming that it remained enforceable and any obligations in respect of the right had been complied with).     2   If the eligible person is still alive or in existence, the rights that the eligible person would have under this Schedule are exercisable by the other person and not by the eligible person.     3   If the eligible person is no longer alive or in existence, the rights that the eligible person would have under this Schedule if that person were still alive or in existence are exercisable by the other person.     4   The right exercisable by the other person under sub-paragraph  (2)  or  (3)  is subject to any restriction, condition or other incident to which the right vested in that person as imagined under sub-paragraph  (1)  would be subject.     5   Additional compensation paid to the other person by virtue of sub-paragraph  (2)  or  (3)  must be dealt with by the person in any way in which the person would have to deal with compensation paid to that person further to the right vested in that person as imagined under sub-paragraph  (1) .     6   If a person is an eligible person by virtue of paragraph  4 (1) , the reference in sub-paragraph  (1)  to compensation to which the person was entitled is to be read as a reference to the compensation to which the person would have been entitled but for the mortgage.        Consequential losses   6    1   The relevant authority may by regulations provide for additional compensation payable on a claim under paragraph  1 (5)  to include (in addition to any amount payable under paragraph  2 ) an amount to make good qualifying losses.     2   \u201cQualifying losses\u201d are financial losses shown to have been suffered by an eligible person, or a person entitled to exercise the rights of the eligible person under paragraph  5 , as a result of the compensation initially payable to the eligible person in respect of the acquisition being of the original amount rather than the alternative amount.     3   In the case of an eligible person who is so by virtue of an interest that was subject to a mortgage, the reference in sub-paragraph  (2)  to compensation payable to the eligible person is to be taken to include compensation payable to the mortgagee of that interest.     4   Regulations under this paragraph may limit the qualifying losses in respect of which additional compensation is payable under the regulations by reference to\u2014   a   a description of loss,     b   an amount, or     c   any other circumstance.          Procedure etc   7    1   The relevant authority may by regulations make provision\u2014   a   about the procedure for applications under paragraph  1 (2)  or claims under paragraph  1 (5)  (including provision about the costs of such applications or claims);     b   about steps that must be taken by the acquiring authority or the confirming authority for the purposes of publicising or giving notice of a direction for additional compensation;     c   for interest to be applied to amounts of additional compensation that are payable;     d   about how or when additional compensation (and any interest) is to be paid.       2   Regulations under this paragraph about costs of claims under paragraph  1 (5) \u2014   a   may modify or disapply section 29 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (costs or expenses) or provisions in Tribunal Procedure Rules relating to costs;     b   may apply (with or without modifications) section 4 of this Act;    and section 4 of this Act does not apply in relation to such a claim unless so applied.        Regulations   8    1   For the purposes of this Schedule \u201cthe relevant authority\u201d is\u2014   a   the Secretary of State, in relation to England;     b   the Welsh Ministers, in relation to Wales.       2   Regulations under this Schedule may make\u2014   a   consequential, supplementary, incidental, transitional or saving provision;     b   different provision for different purposes.       3   Regulations under this Schedule are to be made by statutory instrument.     4   A statutory instrument containing such regulations is subject to annulment in pursuance of\u2014   a   a resolution of either House of Parliament, in the case of regulations made by the Secretary of State, or     b   a resolution of Senedd Cymru, in the case of regulations made by the Welsh Ministers.          Interpretation   9    1   In this Schedule\u2014   a   \u201c the confirming authority \u201d means\u2014   i   the person who confirmed the compulsory purchase order, or     ii   any successor to that person\u2019s function of confirming compulsory purchase orders of the type in question;       b   references to \u201cthe acquisition\u201d or \u201cthe compulsory purchase order\u201d are to the acquisition or order by virtue of which paragraph  1  applies;     c   references to the acquisition of an interest in land include\u2014   i   the creation of such an interest, and     ii   the acquisition or creation of a right in or over land;    and references to interests in land are to be read accordingly.       2   In the case of a compulsory purchase order made under section 10(1) of, and Part 1 of Schedule 4 to, the New Towns Act 1981 (compulsory acquisition by new town development corporation in usual cases), the reference in paragraph  1 (4)  to section  15A (3)  of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 is to be read as a reference to paragraph  5A (2)  of Schedule 4 to the New Towns Act 1981.     3   In the case of a compulsory purchase order made under section 13(1)(a) of, and Part 1 of Schedule 5 to, the New Towns Act 1981 (compulsory acquisition by new town development corporation of statutory undertakers\u2019 operational land)\u2014   a   the reference in paragraph  1 (4)  to section  15A (3)  of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 is to be read as a reference to paragraph  5A (2)  of Schedule 5 to the New Towns Act 1981, and     b   the references in paragraph  1 (4)  and sub-paragraph  (1) (a)  to the confirmation of the order are to be read as references to the making of the order.       4   In the case of a compulsory purchase order made under section 21A(1)(b) or (2)(b) of the Welsh Development Agency Act 1975 (compulsory acquisition by Welsh Ministers of land in Wales for Welsh development purposes)\u2014   a   the reference in paragraph  1 (4)  to submission under section  15A (3)  of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 is to be read as a reference to preparation under paragraph  3B (2)  of Schedule 4 to the Welsh Development Agency Act 1975, and     b   the references in paragraph  1 (4)  and sub-paragraph  (1) (a)  to the confirmation of the order are to be read as references to the making of the order.       5   If\u2014   a   an interest in land is acquired further to section 154(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (deemed compulsory acquisition further to blight notice), and     b   the land falls within paragraph 22 of Schedule 13 to that Act (land blighted by compulsory purchase order),    the interest is to be treated for the purposes of this Schedule as having been acquired further to the compulsory purchase order by virtue of which the land falls within that paragraph.               3   In the New Towns Act 1981\u2014   a   in Schedule 4 (procedure for compulsory acquisition by new town development corporation in usual cases), after paragraph 5 insert\u2014    5A    1   A development corporation submitting an order to the Secretary of State under this Part of this Schedule may include in the order a direction that compensation is to be assessed in accordance with section  14A  of the Land Compensation Act 1961 (cases where prospect of planning permission to be ignored);

    b   otherwise, must modify the order so as to remove the direction.       9   If the order is confirmed with the direction included, the notice under paragraph 5 must\u2014   a   state the effect of the direction,     b   explain how the statement of commitments may be viewed, and     c   explain that additional compensation may become payable if the statement of commitments is not fulfilled.       10   In this paragraph\u2014     \u201c the project land \u201d means\u2014     the land proposed to be acquired further to the compulsory purchase order, and      any other land that the corporation intends to be used in connection with that land;

    b   the new lease is granted under\u2014   i   section 24 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (renewed business leases),     ii   section 14 of, or Schedule 1 to, the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 (extension of leases of houses), or     iii   section 56 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (extension of leases of flats),    in a case where that provision of that Act applies by virtue of the other lease.       4   For the purposes of subsection (1)(e) there is continuity in the property let if\u2014   a   the newly let property is exactly the same as the already let property,     b   the newly let property consists of some or all of the already let property, together with other property (whether or not that other property was previously let) (a \u201cproperty combination\u201d), or     c   the newly let property consists of some, but not all, of the already let property (but no other property) (a \u201cproperty reduction\u201d).       5   But there is no continuity in the property let by virtue of a property reduction if, as respects any lease in the relevant chain of qualifying leases, there was continuity in the property let by virtue of a property combination.     6   For that purpose, the \u201crelevant\u201d chain of qualifying leases is the chain of qualifying leases of which the new lease would be part were it a connected replacement lease.     7   For the purposes of subsection (1)(e) there is also continuity in the property let if the new lease is granted to rectify any error in the lease, or any lease, which the new lease replaces.     8   Where a dwelling is at any time on or after 14 February 2022 let under two or more leases to which subsection (1)(a) and (b) apply, any of the leases which is superior to any of the other leases is not a connected replacement lease.     9   For the purposes of sections 122 to 125 and Schedule 8, all of the leases in a chain of qualifying leases are to be treated as a single qualifying lease which has a term that\u2014   a   began when the term of the initial qualifying lease in that chain began, and     b   ends when the term of the current connected replacement lease in that chain ends.       10   The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision about the meaning of \u201c connected replacement lease \u201d (including provision changing the meaning).     11   The provision that may be made in regulations under this section includes\u2014   a   provision which amends this section;
