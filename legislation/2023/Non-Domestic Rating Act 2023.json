His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs may serve a notice (a \u201cpenalty notice\u201d) on P stating\u2014   a   that P has failed to make a taxpayer reference notification in accordance with

paid,     e   that P has a right to require a review under  paragraph 5BA , and     f   that P has a right of appeal under  paragraph 5BB .       5   A penalty notice may be served in relation to one or more liabilities under this paragraph.     6   A penalty imposed under  sub-paragraph (1)  or  (2)  must be paid within the period of 30 days beginning with the date of the penalty notice (but see  paragraph 5BC (1)  and  (2) ).     7   Where P is liable to a penalty under  sub-paragraph (1)  or  (2)  and fails to comply with the requirement to make a taxpayer reference notification within the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the penalty notice is served, P is liable to a maximum further penalty of \u00a360 for each day on which the failure continues after the end of that period (but see  sub-paragraph (8) ).     8   P\u2019s total liability under  sub-paragraph (7)  may not exceed \u00a31,800.       5ZB   An officer of His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs may mitigate or remit any penalty imposed under  paragraph 5ZA .         5   After  paragraph 5ZB  (inserted by  subsection (4) ) insert\u2014    Information to be provided to valuation officer: penalties: England   5ZC    1   Where a person (\u201c P \u201d) fails to comply with a valuation notification requirement (including where P makes a false statement in purported compliance with the requirement), P is liable to a penalty the amount of which is determined in accordance with  paragraph 5ZD (1) .     2   Where P knowingly or recklessly makes a false statement in purported compliance with a valuation notification requirement, P commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale or to both (but see  sub-paragraph (7) ).     3   A valuation officer may, if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that P has committed an offence under  sub-paragraph (2) , determine that P is instead liable to a penalty the amount of which is determined in accordance with  paragraph 5ZD (2)  (see also  sub-paragraphs (9)  and  (10)  of this paragraph).     4   Where P is liable to a penalty under  sub-paragraph (1)  or  (3) , the valuation officer may serve a notice (a \u201cpenalty notice\u201d) on P stating\u2014   a   the valuation notification requirement with which P has failed to comply,     b   that P is liable to a penalty under  sub-paragraph (1)  or  (3)  (as the case may be),     c   the amount of the penalty,     d   the period within which the penalty must be paid,     e   in a case where P is liable to a penalty under  sub-paragraph (1) , the effect of  paragraph 5ZD (3) ,     f   that P has a right to require a review under  paragraph 5BD , and     g   that P has a right of appeal under  paragraph 5BE .       5   A penalty notice may be served in relation to one or more liabilities under this paragraph.     6   A penalty imposed under  sub-paragraph (1)  or  (3)  must be paid within the period of 30 days beginning with the date of the penalty notice (but see  paragraph 5BF (1)  and  (2) ).     7   Where a penalty notice is served on P in relation to a liability under  sub-paragraph (3)  in respect of a false statement\u2014   a   no criminal proceedings for an offence under  sub-paragraph (2)  may be instituted against P, and no further penalty notice may be served, in respect of the false statement before the end of the period within which the liability under  sub-paragraph (3)  may be discharged as a result of payment or remittance of the penalty;     b   if the liability under  sub-paragraph (3)  is discharged (for any reason), then in respect of the false statement\u2014   i   no criminal proceedings for an offence under  sub-paragraph (2)  may be instituted against P (and P may not at any time be convicted of an offence under that sub-paragraph in any proceedings that have already been instituted);     ii   no further penalty notice may be served on P in relation to liability under  sub-paragraph (3)  in respect of the false statement;       c   if the liability under  sub-paragraph (3)  is discharged as a result of the payment of the penalty, then, in respect of the false statement, any penalty notice previously served on P in relation to liability under  sub-paragraph (1)  which has not been discharged ceases to have effect.       8   The discharge of liability under  sub-paragraph (3)  in respect of a false statement as a result of the remittance of a penalty does not prevent a penalty notice being served in relation to any liability under sub-paragraph  (1)  in respect of that false statement.     9   Sub-paragraph (10)  applies where\u2014   a   a penalty notice is served on P in relation to a liability under  sub-paragraph (1)  in respect of a false statement,     b   P\u2019s liability under that sub-paragraph has been discharged as a result of P paying the penalty, and     c   either\u2014   i   P is subsequently convicted of an offence under  sub-paragraph (2)  in respect of the false statement, or     ii   a penalty notice (\u201cthe subsequent penalty notice\u201d) is subsequently served on P in relation to a liability under  sub-paragraph (3)  in respect of the false statement.         10   The sentence on conviction, or the amount of the penalty stated in the subsequent penalty notice, must reflect the amount of the penalty paid by P in discharging P\u2019s liability under  sub-paragraph (1) .     11   For the purposes this paragraph and in  paragraphs 5ZD  and  5ZE \u2014     \u201c false statement \u201d means a statement made by P which is false in a material particular;      \u201c valuation notification requirement \u201d means a requirement under  paragraph 4J  to  4M .          5ZD    1   Where P is liable to a penalty under  paragraph 5ZC (1) , the maximum amount of the penalty is the greater of\u2014   a   2% of the rateable value shown in a list compiled under this Part or, if greater, of the actual rateable value of the hereditament concerned for the day on which the liability to the penalty arises, and     b   \u00a3900.       2   Where P is liable to a penalty under  paragraph 5ZC (3) , the maximum amount of the penalty is the sum of\u2014   a   3% of the rateable value shown in a list compiled under this Part or, if greater, of the actual rateable value of the hereditament concerned for the day on which the liability to the penalty arises, and     b   \u00a3500.       3   Where P is liable to a penalty under  paragraph 5ZC (1)  and fails to comply with the valuation notification requirement within the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the penalty notice is served, P is liable to a maximum further penalty of \u00a360 for each day on which the failure continues after the end of that period (but see  sub-paragraph (4) ).     4   P\u2019s total liability under  sub-paragraph (3)  may not exceed

matter within  sub-paragraph (2) , would be shown in a list compiled under this Part for the day on which the liability to the penalty arises if P had complied with all valuation notification requirements;     b   the \u201chereditament concerned\u201d is the hereditament in relation to which the valuation notification requirement applies to P;     c   a list compiled under this Part is to be used to find the rateable value of the hereditament for the day concerned.       2   A matter is within this sub-paragraph if\u2014   a   a change occurs in relation to it at any time during the period beginning with the specified day and ending with the day on which the liability to the penalty arises, and     b   the change results or would result in a reduction in the rateable value of the hereditament shown in a list compiled under this Part for the day concerned.       3   For the purposes of  sub-paragraph (2)  the \u201cspecified day\u201d is\u2014   a   where the penalty notice is served in respect of a failure by P to provide notifiable information under  paragraph 4J , the first day of the notification period (within the meaning of that paragraph), or     b   where the penalty notice is served in respect of a failure by P to provide information that is\u2014   i   required by an information notice under  paragraph 4M (1) , but     ii   not required to be provided under  paragraph 4J ,    the day on which the information notice is served.         5ZF   A valuation officer may mitigate or remit any penalty imposed under  paragraph 5ZC  or  5ZD .         6

paragraph 5ZA (4)  may require a review of the decision to serve the penalty notice.     2   P requires a review under  sub-paragraph (1)  by giving notice to the issuing officer within the period of 30 days beginning with the date of the penalty notice\u2014   a   using the online facility provided by the issuing officer for use in connection with notices under this paragraph, or     b   in another manner agreed with the issuing officer.       3   Sub-paragraphs (4)  to  (9)  apply where P gives notice in accordance with  sub-paragraph (2) .     4   The review must be carried out by a reviewing officer.     5   The reviewing officer must have regard to anything done by P or the issuing officer in connection with the decision to serve the penalty notice.     6   Otherwise, the

A2 In this Part\u2014 a Chapter 2 makes provision about the calculation of the non-domestic rating multiplier; b Chapter 3 makes provision about the calculation of the small business non-domestic rating multiplier; c Chapter 4 makes provision about the making, and the giving of notice, of such calculations; d Chapter 5 makes provision about the interpretation of terms used in this Part; e Chapter 6 makes provision about regulations under this Part. CHAPTER 2 The non-domestic rating multiplier Revaluation years A3 The non-domestic rating multiplier for a revaluation year is to be calculated in accordance with the formula\u2014 A \u00d7 C \u00d7 E D \u00d7 F Other years A4 1 The non-domestic rating multiplier for a chargeable financial year other than a revaluation year is\u2014 a the default amount, or b if the Secretary of State makes an adjustment to that amount under  sub-paragraph (3) , that amount as adjusted. 2 The default amount is to be calculated in accordance with the formula\u2014 A \u00d7 C D 3 The Secretary of State makes an adjustment to the default amount by adjusting it to reflect the extent to which the Secretary of State\u2019s last estimate of the total mentioned in  paragraph A10 (6)  or  (7)  appears to the Secretary of State to differ from the actual total. CHAPTER 3 The small business non-domestic rating multiplier Revaluation years A5 The small business non-domestic rating multiplier for a revaluation year is to be calculated in accordance with the formula\u2014 B \u00d7 C \u00d7 E D \u00d7 F Other years A6 1 The small business non-domestic rating multiplier for a chargeable financial year other than a revaluation year is\u2014 a the default amount, or b if the Secretary of State makes an adjustment to that amount under  sub-paragraph (3) , that amount as adjusted. 2 The default amount is to be calculated in accordance with the formula\u2014 B \u00d7 C D 3 The Secretary of State makes an adjustment to the default amount by adjusting it to reflect the extent to which the Secretary of State\u2019s last estimate of the total mentioned in  paragraph A10 (6)  or  (7)  appears to the Secretary of State to differ from the actual total. CHAPTER 4 Making and giving notice of calculations etc A7 1 The Secretary of State must\u2014 a calculate the non-domestic rating multiplier and the small business non-domestic rating multiplier for a chargeable financial year, and b as soon as reasonably practicable after doing so, serve on each billing authority a notice stating the multipliers as so calculated. 2 A notice under  sub-paragraph (1) (b)  must show how any calculation has been made and contain details of\u2014 a any estimates that have been made under  paragraph A10 (6)  or  (7) , including the date determined under  paragraph A11 (3)  for the purpose of making those estimates, and b any adjustments that have been made under  paragraph A4 (3)  or  A6 (3) 3 Where the chargeable financial year is one for which the Secretary of State has calculated a figure for D under  paragraph A10 (5) (b) , the notice under  sub-paragraph (1) (b)  must contain that figure. A8 A calculation made by the Secretary of State under  paragraph A7  is invalid if it is made at a time when regulations under  paragraph A10 (4) (b)  have not come into force which, if they had come into force, would be effective in relation to the year.
