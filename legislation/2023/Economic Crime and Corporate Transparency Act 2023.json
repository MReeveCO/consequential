Application to court for revival 23 1 An application may be made to the court to revive a limited partnership that has been dissolved under section  19 (6)  (dissolution on publication of notice in Gazette). 2 An application under this section may be made by\u2014 a the Secretary of State, b a person who was a partner in the limited partnership immediately before it was dissolved, or c any other person appearing to the court to have an interest in the matter. 3 An application to the court for the revival of a limited partnership may only be made\u2014 a within the period of six years beginning with the date on which the limited partnership was dissolved, or b where the applicant made an application under section  20  that was refused, within the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which notice of the registrar\u2019s decision was sent by the registrar to the applicant. Decision on application for revival by the court 24 1 If, on an application under section  23 , the court orders revival of the limited partnership, the revival takes effect on a copy of the court\u2019s order being delivered to the registrar. 2 The registrar must publish a notice in the Gazette of the revival of the limited partnership. 3 The notice must state\u2014 a the limited partnership\u2019s name (which must be the name that it had before it was dissolved under section  19 (6) ), b the limited partnership\u2019s registration number, and c the date on which the revival of the limited partnership takes effect. Effect of court order for revival 25 1 The general effect of an order by the court for revival is that the limited partnership is to be treated as having continued in existence as a limited partnership as if it had not been dissolved under section  19 (6) . 2 The court may give such directions and make such provision as seems just for placing the limited partnership and all other persons in the same position (as nearly as may be) as if the limited partnership had not been dissolved under section  19 (6) . 3 The court may also give directions as to\u2014 a the delivery to the registrar of such documents relating to the limited partnership as are necessary to bring up to date the records kept by the registrar, or b the payment of the costs (in Scotland, expenses) of the registrar in connection with the proceedings for the revival of the limited partnership. 3 In section 3 (interpretation of terms), in subsection (1) (created by section 110 of this Act), at the appropriate place insert\u2014 \u201c the Gazette \u201d means\u2014 as respects limited partnerships registered in England and Wales, the London Gazette, as respects limited partnerships registered in Scotland, the Edinburgh Gazette, and as respects limited partnerships registered in Northern Ireland, the Belfast Gazette;
