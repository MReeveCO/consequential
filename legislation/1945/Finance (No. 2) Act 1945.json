December, nineteen hundred and forty-five, or any part of a chargeable accounting period, being a part beginning on or after the said first day of April and ending on or before the said thirty-first day of December, which falls to be treated for the purposes of section twenty-eight of the Finance Act, 1941, as a separate chargeable accounting period; \u201c net amount \u201d means, in relation to a post-war refund, the gross amount thereof less the income tax deducted therefrom, and, where the payment is made otherwise than to a body corporate, less also any surtax ascribable to the payment of the refund, the amount of surtax so ascribable being ascertained on the basis that the refund is to be treated as the highest part of the income of the person to whom the payment is paid; \u201c group of companies, \u201d                        \u201c the principal company \u201d and \u201c subsidiary member \u201d have the meanings respectively assigned to them by subsection (1) of section twenty-eight of the Finance Act, 1940. 2 References in this Part of this Act to the national defence contribution for a relevant chargeable accounting period shall, where the relevant chargeable accounting period is not also a chargeable accounting period for the purposes of the national defence contribution, be taken to be references to a sum made up by apportioning and aggregating the amounts of the national defence contribution paid or payable in respect of any chargeable accounting period (as defined for the purposes of the national defence contribution) which falls wholly or partly within the relevant chargeable accounting period. Any apportionment required to be made by this subsection shall be made by reference to the number of months or fractions of months in the period to which the apportionment relates. 3 Any reference in this Part of this Act or in the Sixth Schedule to this Act to the relevant chargeable accounting periods to which a post-war refund is referable shall be construed as a reference to the relevant chargeable accounting periods in which there was extra tax, and any reference in this Part of this Act or in the said Sixth Schedule to the amount of refund which is referable to any such period shall be construed as a reference to an amount which bears to the total amount of the refund the same proportion as the extra tax in that period bears to the sum of the amounts of extra tax in all the periods to which the refund is referable. For the purposes of this subsection, if the excess profits tax for any of the relevant chargeable accounting periods exceeds the national defence contribution for that period, there shall be deemed to have been extra tax for that period equal to whichever of the two following amounts is the smaller, that is to say\u2014 a twenty per cent. of the excess profits tax for the period; and b the amount by which the excess profits tax for the period exceeds the national defence contribution for the period: Provided that, if the national defence contribution is equal to or exceeds the excess profits tax in the case of all the relevant chargeable accounting periods, there shall be deemed to have been extra tax for all the chargeable accounting periods for which there was excess profits tax, equal, in the case of each such period, to twenty per cent. of the excess profits tax for that period. In determining for the purposes of this subsection whether there is any, and, if so, what excess profits tax for any period, any national defence contribution payable for that or any other period shall be disregarded except in computing capital and any relief for any deficiency of profits occurring in any other chargeable accounting period shall be altogether disregarded, and in determining for the said purposes whether there is any, and, if so, what national defence contribution for any period, excess profits tax shall be altogether disregarded. 4 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
