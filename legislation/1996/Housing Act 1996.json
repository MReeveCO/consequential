member of his household) which affects his suitability to be a tenant; c any local connection (within the meaning of   section 81 of the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 ) which exists between a person and the authority\u2019s district. 2B Nothing in subsection (2) requires the scheme to provide for any preference to be given to people the authority have decided are people to whom subsection (2C) applies. 2C This subsection applies to a person if the authority are satisfied that\u2014 a he, or a member of his household, has been guilty of unacceptable behaviour serious enough to make him unsuitable to be a tenant of the authority; and b in the circumstances at the time his case is considered, he deserves by reason of that behaviour not to be treated as a member of a group of people who are to be given preference by virtue of subsection (2). 2D Subsection (8) of section 160A applies for the purposes of subsection (2C)(a) above as it applies for the purposes of subsection (7)(a) of that section. 2E Subject to subsection (2), the scheme may contain provision about the allocation of particular housing accommodation\u2014 a to a person who makes a specific application for that accommodation; b to persons of a particular description (whether or not they are within subsection (2)). 3 The Secretary of State may by regulations\u2014 a specify further descriptions of people to whom preference is to be given as mentioned in subsection (2), or b amend or repeal any part of subsection (2). 4 The Secretary of State may by regulations specify factors which a local housing authority   in Wales  shall not take into account in allocating housing accommodation. 4A The scheme shall be framed so as to secure that an applicant for an allocation of housing accommodation\u2014 a has the right to request such general information as will enable him to assess\u2014 i how his application is likely to be treated under the scheme (including in particular whether he is likely to be regarded as a member of a group of people who are to be given preference by virtue of subsection (2)); and ii whether housing accommodation appropriate to his needs is likely to be made available to him and, if so, how long it is likely to be before such accommodation becomes available for allocation to him; b is notified in writing of any decision that he is a person to whom subsection (2C) applies and the grounds for it; c has the right to request the authority to inform him of any decision about the facts of his case which is likely to be, or has been, taken into account in considering whether to allocate housing accommodation to him; and d has the right to request a review of a decision mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c), or in section 160A(9), and to be informed of the decision on the review and the grounds for it. 5 As regards the procedure to be followed, the scheme shall be framed in accordance with such principles as the Secretary of State may prescribe by regulations. 6 Subject to the above provisions, and to any regulations made under them, the authority may decide on what principles the scheme is to be framed. 7 Before adopting an allocation scheme, or making an alteration to their scheme reflecting a major change of policy, a local housing authority  in Wales   shall\u2014 a send a copy of the draft scheme, or proposed alteration, to every   private registered provider of social housing and  registered social landlord with which they have nomination arrangements (see section 159(4)), and b afford those persons a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposals. 8 A local housing authority  in Wales   shall not allocate housing accommodation except in accordance with their allocation scheme."}, {"act": "Housing Act 1996", "year": 1996,
