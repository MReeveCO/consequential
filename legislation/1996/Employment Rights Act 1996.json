apply in the individual's case as a result of subsections (3) and (4), c state whether any voting rights attach to the employee shares, d state whether the employee shares carry any rights to dividends, e state whether the employee shares would, if the company were wound up, confer any rights to participate in the distribution of any surplus assets, f if the company has more than one class of shares and any of the rights referred to in paragraphs (c) to (e) attach to the employee shares, explain how those rights differ from the equivalent rights that attach to the shares in the largest class (or next largest class if the class which includes the employee shares is the largest), g state whether the employee shares are redeemable and, if they are, at whose option, h state whether there are any restrictions on the transferability of the employee shares and, if there are, what those restrictions are, i state whether any of the requirements of sections 561 and 562 of the Companies Act 2006 are excluded in the case of the employee shares (existing shareholders' right of pre-emption), and j state whether the employee shares are subject to drag-along rights or tag-along rights and, if they are, explain the effect of the shares being so subject. 6 Agreement between a company and an individual that the individual is to become an employee shareholder is of no effect unless, before the agreement is made\u2014 a the individual, having been given the statement referred to in subsection (1)(c), receives advice from a relevant independent adviser as to the terms and effect of the proposed agreement, and b seven days have passed since the day on which the individual receives the advice. 7 Any reasonable costs incurred by the individual in obtaining the advice (whether or not the individual becomes an employee shareholder) which would, but for this subsection, have to be met by the individual are instead to be met by the company. 8 The reference in subsection (2)(b) to making an application under section 80F does not include a reference to making an application within the period of 14 days beginning with the day on which the employee shareholder returns to work from a period of parental leave under regulations under section 76. 9 The reference in subsection (2)(c) to unfair dismissal does not include a reference to a dismissal\u2014 a which is required to be regarded as unfair for the purposes of Part 10 by a provision (whenever made) contained in or made under this or any other Act, or b which amounts to a contravention of the Equality Act 2010. 10 The reference in subsection (2)(c) to the right not to be unfairly dismissed does not include a reference to that right in a case where section 108(2) (health and safety cases) applies. 11 The Secretary of State may by order amend subsection (1) so as to increase the sum for the time being specified there. 12 The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that any agreement for a company to buy back from an individual the shares referred to in subsection (1)(b) in the event that the individual ceases to be an employee shareholder or ceases to be an employee must be on terms which meet the specified requirements. 13 In this section\u2014 \u201c company \u201d means\u2014 a company or overseas company (within the meaning, in each case, of the Companies Act 2006) which has

rights \u201d, in relation to shares in a company, means the right of the holders of a majority of the shares, where they are selling their shares, to require the holders of the minority to sell theirs; \u201c parent undertaking \u201d has the same meaning as in the Companies Act 2006; \u201c relevant independent adviser \u201d has the meaning that it has for the purposes of section
