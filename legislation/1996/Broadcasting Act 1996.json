holder in relation to whom those powers are to be exercised a reasonable opportunity, before they are exercised, of making representations to OFCOM. 8   OFCOM   shall publish, monthly or at such other intervals as they think fit and in such manner as they think fit, reports each containing, as regards every fairness complaint  ... which falls within this subsection and has been dealt with by them

person   11 The references in subsections (3)(b) and (8)(b) to  OFCOM \u2019s findings on a complaint shall be construed, in relation to a fairness complaint which has been considered by them in two
