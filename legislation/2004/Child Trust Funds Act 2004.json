opinion, is appropriate. 3 A decision to impose such a penalty may not be made after the end of the period of six years beginning with the date on which the penalty was incurred or began to be incurred. 4 The Inland Revenue must give notice of such a decision to the person on whom the penalty is imposed. 5 The notice must state the date on which it is given and give details of the right to appeal against the decision under section 22. 6 After the notice has been given, the decision must not be altered except on appeal. 7 But the Inland Revenue may, in their discretion, mitigate any penalty under section 20. 8 A penalty under section 20 becomes payable at the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the date on which notice of the decision is given. 9 On an appeal under section 22 against a decision under this section, the  appropriate tribunal  may\u2014 a if it appears that no penalty has been incurred, set the decision aside, b if the amount set appears to be
