if an interim order is made, there is a reasonable prospect that the dwelling will become occupied, d that the authority have complied with section 133(3), and e that any prescribed requirements have

compensation in respect of any interference in consequence of the order with the rights of the third party. 5 The appropriate national authority may by order\u2014 a prescribe exceptions for the
