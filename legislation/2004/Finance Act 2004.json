reduced by an amount due to the lessee under the operating lease, that reduction shall be disregarded when taking the amount receivable into account. 5 The amounts receivable in respect of the lessor\u2019s interest under the operating lease that fall to be taken into account in that calculation may be disregarded to the extent that they exceed the relevant amount (whether or not subsection (4) applies). 6 Where only some of the plant or machinery is the subject of the operating lease, subsections (2) to (5) shall apply subject to such apportionments as may be just and reasonable. 7 For the purposes of this section a lease is accounted for as a finance lease in a person\u2019s accounts if\u2014 a the lease falls, under generally accepted accounting practice, to be treated in that

pension under the other scheme (\u201cthe new pension\u201d), provide that the new pension is to be treated, to such extent as is prescribed and for such of the purposes of this Part as are

Relevant benefits 393B 1 In this Chapter  \u201c relevant benefits \u201d means any lump sum, gratuity or other benefit (including a non-cash benefit) provided (or to be provided)\u2014 a on or in anticipation of the retirement of an employee or former employee, b on the death of an employee or former employee, c after the retirement or death of an employee or former employee in connection with past service, d on or in anticipation of, or in connection with, any change in the nature of service of an employee, or e to any person by virtue of a pension sharing order or provision relating to an employee or former employee. 2 But\u2014 a benefits charged to tax under Part 9 (pension income), b benefits chargeable to tax by virtue of Schedule 34 to FA 2004 (which applies certain charges under Part 4 of that Act in relation to non-UK schemes), and c excluded benefits, are not relevant benefits. 3 The following are  \u201cexcluded benefits\u201d\u2014 a benefits in respect of ill-health or disablement of an employee during service, b benefits in respect of the death by accident of an employee during service, c benefits under a relevant life policy, and d benefits of any description prescribed by regulations made by the Board of Inland Revenue. 4 In subsection (3)(c)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201c relevant life policy \u201d means\u2014 a  an excepted group life policy as defined in section 480 of  ITTOIA  2005,   b a policy of life insurance the terms of which provide for the payment of benefits on the death of a single individual and with respect to which \u2014  i condition A in section 481 of that Act would be met if paragraph (a) in that condition referred to the death, in any circumstances or except in specified circumstances, of that individual (rather than the death in any circumstances of each of the individuals insured under the policy) and if the condition did not include paragraph (b), and ii conditions C and D in that section and conditions A and C in section 482 of that Act are met, or c a policy of life insurance that would be within paragraph (a) or (b) but for the fact that it provides for a benefit which is an excluded benefit under or by virtue of paragraph (a), (b) or (d) of subsection (3). 5 In subsection (1)(e)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201c pension sharing order or provision \u201d means any such order or provision as is mentioned in section 28(1) of WRPA 1999 or Article 25(1) of WRP(NI)O 1999. 4 Section 394 (charge on benefit) is amended as follows. 5 After subsection (1) insert\u2014 1A Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to the benefit if the total amount of the benefits to which this Chapter applies received by the individual in the relevant tax year does not exceed \u00a3100. 6 In subsection (2), for  \u201cadministrator of\u201d substitute  \u201cperson who is (or persons who are) the responsible person in relation to\u201d . 7 In subsection (3), for  \u201csubsections (1) and (2)\u201d substitute  \u201cthis section\u201d . 8 For sections 395 to 397 substitute\u2014 Reduction where employee has contributed 395 1 This section applies in relation to a relevant benefit under an employer-financed retirement benefits scheme in the form of a lump sum where, under the scheme, an employee has paid any sum or sums by way of contribution to the provision of the lump sum. 2 The amount which, by virtue of section 394, counts as employment income, or is chargeable to tax under   subsection (2) of that section , is the amount of the lump sum reduced by the sum, or the aggregate of the sums, paid by the employee by way of contribution to the provision of the lump sum. 3 A reduction under this section may not be claimed in respect of the same contribution in relation to more than one lump sum. 4 It is to be assumed, unless the contrary is shown, that no reduction is applicable under this section. 9 In subsection (1) of section 399 (valuation of benefit in form of loan), for  \u201cadministrator of\u201d substitute  \u201cperson who is (or any of the persons who are) the responsible person in relation to\u201d . 10 In subsection (2) of that section, for  \u201cadministrator\u201d substitute  \u201cresponsible person\u201d . 11 For section 400 substitute\u2014 Responsible person 399A 1 The following heads specify the person who is, or persons who are, the responsible person in relation to an employer-financed retirement benefits scheme for the purposes of this Chapter. 2 But if a person is, or persons are, the responsible person in relation to the scheme by virtue of being specified under one head, no-one is the responsible person in relation to the scheme by virtue of being specified under a later head. Head 1 If there are one or more trustees of the scheme who are resident in the United Kingdom, that trustee or each of those trustees. Head 2 If there are one or more persons who control the management of the scheme, that person or each of those persons. Head 3 If alive or still in existence, the employer, or any of the employers, who established the scheme and any person by whom that employer, or any of those employers, has been directly or indirectly succeeded in relation to the provision of benefits under the scheme. Head 4 Any employer of employees to or in respect of whom benefits are, or are to be, provided under the scheme. Head 5 If there are one or more trustees of the scheme who are not resident in the United Kingdom, that trustee or each of those trustees.

The condition for being a qualifying existing field 6B 1 The condition for an existing field to be a qualifying existing field for the purposes of section 6A above is that at no time in the period of 6 years ending with 8th April 2003 (\u201cthe 6 year period\u201d) was there\u2014 a any use of a disqualifying asset (see subsection (2) below) in a UK area (see subsection (11) below) in relation to

enabling that oil to be used for assisting the extraction of oil from that other field; e if at that time the existing field was not a taxable field, any asset by reference to which an election under section 231 of the Finance Act 1994 (election by reference to asset with excess capacity) was at that time in operation with respect to an oil field. 4 Where any use of an asset is, by virtue of subsection (3) above, use of an excepted asset, the provision of any services or other business facilities of whatever kind in connection with that use of that asset accordingly falls to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) above. 5 Where an asset in a UK area\u2014 a is a qualifying asset in relation to a participator in such an oil field as is mentioned in section 107

applies, then, in determining for the purposes of subsection (1) above whether there has been any use of a disqualifying asset in relation to the existing field or oil won from it, any use of the asset in relation to that field or oil won from it shall be treated\u2014 a as use of a qualifying asset in relation to a participator in an oil field, if or to the extent that the use is attributable, on a just and reasonable basis, to a participator in the UK sector, or b as use of an asset which was not a qualifying asset in relation to a participator in an oil field, if or to the extent that the use is attributable, on a just and reasonable basis, to a participator in the foreign sector. 7 For the purposes of subsection (3) above, the existing field is expected not to be a tanker loading field if, at the time when the relevant contract is entered into, it is expected that all (or virtually all) of the oil (other than oil consisting of gas) to be won from that field and transported from it after the beginning of the operational period will be so transported otherwise than by tanker. 8 For the purposes of subsection (7) above\u2014 a \u201c the relevant contract \u201d means the contract mentioned in section 6A(2)(b) above; and b \u201c the beginning of the operational period \u201d means the time at which the qualifying asset to which that contract relates begins to be used under that contract in relation to the existing field or oil won from that field. 9 For the purposes of subsection (3) above a tanker is a dedicated tanker at any time if\u2014 a the existing field mentioned in that subsection is an oil field, and b at that time the tanker is a mobile asset dedicated to that oil field (see section 2 above). 10 For the purposes of subsection (3) above a tanker is a non-dedicated tanker\u2014 a at any time, if the existing field mentioned in that subsection is not an oil field, or b where that field is an oil field, at any time when the tanker is not a mobile asset dedicated to that oil field. 11 In this section  \u201c UK area \u201d means each of the following\u2014 a the United Kingdom; b the territorial sea of the United Kingdom; c a designated area, to the extent that it does not fall to be treated by virtue of section 6A(6) above as a foreign field. 12 This section shall be construed as one with section 6A above. . 4 In Schedule
