section applies to an occupational pension scheme other than a scheme which is\u2014 a a money purchase scheme, or b a prescribed scheme or a scheme of a prescribed description. 3 The assets of the scheme must be applied first towards satisfying the amounts of the liabilities mentioned in subsection (4) and, if the assets are insufficient to satisfy those amounts in full, then\u2014 a the assets must be applied first towards satisfying the amounts of the liabilities mentioned in earlier paragraphs of subsection (4) before the amounts of the liabilities mentioned in later paragraphs, and b

(see section 318 of that Act); \u201c winding up period \u201d, in relation to an occupational pension scheme to which this section applies, means the period which\u2014 begins with the day on which the time immediately after the beginning of the winding up of the scheme falls, and ends when the winding up of the scheme is completed. Operation of scheme during winding up period 73A 1 This section applies where an occupational pension scheme to which section 73 applies is being wound up. 2 During the winding up period, the trustees or managers of the scheme\u2014 a must secure that any pensions or other benefits (other than money purchase benefits) paid to or in respect of a member are reduced, so far as necessary, to reflect the liabilities of the scheme to or in respect of the member which will be satisfied in accordance with section 73, and b may, for the purposes of paragraph (a), take such steps as they consider appropriate (including steps adjusting future payments) to recover any overpayment or pay any shortfall. 3 During the winding up period\u2014 a no benefits may accrue under the scheme rules to, or in respect of, members of the scheme, and b no new members of any class may be admitted to the scheme. 4 Subsection (3) does not prevent any increase, in a benefit, which would otherwise accrue in accordance with the scheme or any enactment. 5 Subsection (3) does not prevent the accrual of money purchase benefits to the extent that they are derived from income or capital gains arising from the investment of payments which are made by, or in respect of, a member of the scheme. 6 Where a person is entitled to a pension credit derived from another person\u2019s shareable rights under the scheme, subsection (3) does not prevent the trustees or managers of the scheme discharging their liability in respect of the credit under Chapter 1 of Part 4 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (sharing of rights under pension arrangements) by conferring appropriate rights under the scheme on that person. 7 Regulations may require the trustees or managers of the scheme, in prescribed circumstances\u2014 a to adjust the entitlement of a person to a pension or other benefit under the scheme rules where the entitlement arises as a result of a discretionary award which takes effect during the winding up period; b to adjust the entitlement of a person (\u201cthe survivor\u201d) to a pension or other benefit under the scheme rules where\u2014 i a member of the scheme, or a person who was (or might have become) entitled to a pension or other benefit in respect of a member, dies during the winding up period, and ii the survivor\u2019s entitlement is to a pension or other benefit in respect of the member (whether arising on the date of that death or subsequently). 8 Regulations under subsection (7) may, in particular\u2014 a prescribe how the required adjustments to entitlement are to be determined and the manner in which they are to be made; b in a case where the commencement of the winding up of the scheme is backdated (whether in accordance with section 154 of the Pensions Act 2004 (requirement to wind up schemes with sufficient assets to meet protected liabilities) or otherwise), require any adjustment to a person\u2019s entitlement to be made with effect from the time the award takes effect; c without prejudice to sections 10(3) to (9), 73B(2) and 116, make provision about the consequences of breaching the requirements of the regulations. 9 If the scheme confers power on any person other than the trustees or managers of the scheme to apply the assets of the scheme in respect of pensions or other benefits (including increases in pensions or benefits), it cannot be exercised by that person but may, subject to the provisions made by or by virtue of this section and sections 73 and 73B, be exercised instead by the trustees or managers. 10 For the purposes of this section\u2014 \u201c appropriate rights \u201d has the same meaning as in paragraph 5 of Schedule 5 to the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (pension credits: mode of discharge); \u201c discretionary award \u201d means an award of a prescribed description; \u201c shareable rights \u201d has the same meaning as in Chapter 1 of Part 4 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (sharing of rights under pension arrangements); and subsection (10) of section 73 applies as it applies for the purposes of that section.
