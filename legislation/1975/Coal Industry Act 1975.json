and \u201cwill\u201d includes a codicil. 4 The compensation payable in respect of a holding by virtue of this section shall be payable by the  Corporation  and, subject to the following provisions of this section, shall be an amount equal to the compensation payable in respect of that holding under sections 18 and 19 of this Act for the last twelve months of the period of occupation. 5 Subject to the following provisions of this section, in any case where the compensation last payable in respect of a holding under sections 18 and 19 was in fact payable by reference to a period of less than twelve months, the compensation payable in respect of that holding by virtue of this section shall be an amount equal to the compensation which was so payable under sections 18 and 19, multiplied by the fraction of which the numerator is 365 and the denominator is the number of days in the period by reference to which the compensation was so payable under those sections. 6 Where the person entitled, immediately after the end of the period of occupation, to occupy the holding concerned ceases, before he enters into occupation, to be entitled to occupy some part of it then, subject to subsection (7) below,\u2014 a his entry into occupation of the part which he remains entitled to occupy shall be treated for the purposes of subsection (1) above as entry into occupation of the holding ; but b the compensation payable to him by virtue of this section shall be such proportion of the compensation which would have been so payable had he remained entitled to enter into occupation of the whole of the holding as is properly attributable to the part of the holding which he remains entitled to occupy. 7 If, immediately before the end of the period of occupation, only part of the holding concerned (in this subsection referred to as \u201cthe compensatable portion\u201d) was comprised in the compulsory rights order and (after the end of the period of occupation) subsection (6) above applies, then\u2014 a if the part of the holding which the person concerned ceased to be entitled to occupy comprises the whole of the compensatable portion, no compensation shall be payable to him by virtue of this section ;
