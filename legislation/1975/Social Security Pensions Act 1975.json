150(1)(c) of that Act  are to be increased by a specified percentage the Minister for the Civil Service shall by order provide that the annual rate of an official pension may, if a qualifying condition is satisfied or the pension is  a derivative or substituted pension or a relevant injury pension , be increased in respect of any period beginning on or after the date on which the direction takes effect\u2014 a if the pension began before the beginning of the base period for that direction, by the same percentage as that specified in the direction; b if the pension began during the base period, by that percentage multiplied byA/B where A is the number of complete months in the period between the beginning of the pension and the end of the base period and B is the number of complete months in the base period. 2 Where an order is made under this section in consequence of any such direction as aforesaid the order shall, in addition to the provision required by subsection (1) above, authorise the payment of an increase in respect of any lump sum that becomes payable during the base period for that direction, being an increase equal to the percentage specified in the direction multiplied by A B where\u2014 a A is the number of complete months in the period between the beginning date for the lump sum (or, if later, the date from which it was last authorised to be increased by an order under this section) and the date on which it becomes payable; and b B is the number of complete months in that base period. 3 In the case of the first order made under this section in consequence of any such direction as aforesaid, subsection (1) above shall have effect as if the increase required to be authorised in the case of any pension (whether beginning before or during the base period) were an increase equal to the percentage specified in the direction multiplied by A B where\u2014 a A is the number of complete months in the period between the beginning of the pension (or, if later, the date from which it was last authorised to be increased by an order under section 2 of the  Pensions (Increase) Act 1971) and the end of the base period for that direction; and b B is the number of complete months in that base period. 4 In the case of the first order so made under this section, subsection (2) above shall have effect as if\u2014 a for the reference to any lump sum that becomes payable during the base period there were substituted a reference to any lump sum that becomes or has become payable before the end of the base period but after the date from which official pensions were last increased by an order under section 2 of the  Pensions (Increase) Act 1971; and b the reference in paragraph (a) of the subsection to the date from which the lump sum was last authorised to be increased were a reference to the date specified in paragraph (a) above. 5 The increases in the rate of a pension that may be provided for by an order under this section are to be calculated by reference to the basic rate of the pension as authorised to be increased by section 1 of the said Act of 1971 or by any order under section 2 of that Act or this section; but where\u2014  a a person is entitled to a guaranteed minimum pension when an order under this section comes into force; and b entitlement to that guaranteed minimum pension arises from an employment from which (either directly or by virtue of the payment of a transfer credit  ...) entitlement to the official pension also arises; the amount by reference  to which any increase authorised by that or any subsequent order is to be calculated shall be reduced by an amount equal to the rate of the guaranteed minimum pension. 5ZA In the application of subsection (5) above in relation to a  surviving spouse\u2019s   or surviving civil partner's  pension in a case where the pensioner becomes entitled on the death of the deceased spouse  or civil partner  to such a guaranteed minimum pension as is there mentioned. a the pensioner shall be treated as having been entitled to that guaranteed minimum pension at all times during the period beginning with the date on which the deceased spouse  or civil partner  became entitled to a guaranteed minimum pension and ending with the date of the death; b the rate of the guaranteed minimum pension to which the pensioner is treated as so entitled at any time during that period (\u201c the relevant time \u201d)  shall be taken to be  the rate provided for in subsection (5ZB);  and c the amount by reference to which any increase in the  surviving spouse\u2019s   or surviving civil partner's  pension is to be calculated shall, subject to any directions under section 59A below (whether made before or after the coming into force of this subsection), be accordingly reduced under that subsection by an amount equal to the rate, as determined under paragraph (b) above, of the guaranteed minimum pension to which the pensioner is treated as entitled;  ... 5ZB The rate referred to in subsection (5ZA)(b) is\u2014 a in the case of a pension payable to a woman in respect of the services\u2014 i of her deceased male spouse; or ii of her deceased female spouse in a relevant gender change case; one half of the rate of the deceased spouse\u2019s guaranteed minimum pension at the relevant time; b in the case of  any other surviving spouse\u2019s  pension, one half of so much of the rate of the deceased  spouse\u2019s  guaranteed minimum pension at the relevant time as is attributable to earnings factors for the tax year 1988-89 and subsequent tax years; c in the case of a surviving civil partner's pension, one half of so much of the rate of the deceased civil partner's guaranteed minimum pension at the relevant time as is attributable to earnings factors for the tax year 1988-89 and subsequent tax years. 5ZC Subsection (5ZA)\u2014 a does not apply to\u2014 i a pension payable to a woman in respect of the services of her deceased male spouse; ii a pension payable to a man in respect of the services of his deceased female spouse; iii a pension payable to a woman in respect of the services of her deceased female spouse in a relevant gender change case; or iv a pension payable to a man in respect of the services of his deceased male spouse in a relevant gender change case, in respect of any service of the deceased spouse if that deceased spouse\u2019s pension in respect of that service became payable before 24thJuly 1990;  a does not apply to a pension payable to the survivor of a couple in respect of any service of the deceased member of the couple if\u2014 i the deceased member\u2019s pension in respect of that service became payable before 24 July 1990, ii a marriage between the couple is solemnised at a time (whether or not before the deceased member\u2019s pension in respect of that service became payable) when one of them is a man and the other is a woman and they are not civil partners, and iii at the deceased member\u2019s death (and whether or not the couple are still not of the same sex), the couple are parties to that marriage or to the civil partnership resulting from conversion of that marriage; b applies to a  pension due to a surviving spouse who was married to someone of the same sex  (other than a pension within paragraph (a)(iii) or (iv))   (other than such a pension in respect of the services of the deceased spouse in a relevant gender change case)   and a  surviving civil partner's pension only in respect of amounts payable after the coming into force of this subsection. 5A Nothing in  section 110(2) or (3) of, or paragraph 10 of Schedule 6 to, the Pension Schemes Act 1993  authorises any deduction from an increase in the rate of an official pension under this section. 6 Any order under this section shall be made by statutory instrument and shall be laid before Parliament after being made. 7 In this section\u2014 \u201c base period \u201d, in relation to any such direction as is mentioned in subsection (1) above, means the period ending with the coming into force of that direction and beginning with the coming into force of the last

in relation to a lump sum, shall be construed in accordance with sections 8(2) and 9(2)(a) of the said Act of 1971;   \u201cconversion\u201d, in relation to a marriage, means\u2014 the conversion of that marriage into a civil partnership under Part 3 of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Northern Ireland) (No. 2) Regulations 2020, or the conversion of that marriage into a civil partnership under
