The functions of a local authority under this subsection may be exercised on their behalf by such officers as may be authorised in writing by the authority, and, for the purposes of this subsection, an instrument purporting to be such a certificate as aforesaid and to be signed by an officer of a local authority shall, without further proof, be deemed to be a certificate duly issued, unless the contrary is proved. 6 Where the court is satisfied, on the application of the landlord of any land let on a short tenancy which has been rendered unfit by war damage, that\u2014 a the land is fit: b a period of not less than three months has elapsed since the land was rendered fit, and during the whole of that period the tenant has not been in occupation of the land either in whole or in part and has not paid any rent in respect of that period or any part thereof; and c the landlord has made all reasonable efforts to communicate with the tenant and has failed to do so; the court may, if it thinks fit, determine the tenancy and give immediate possession of the tenant\u2019s interest in the land and, where the tenant has sub-let the whole or any part of the land, the court may give directions preserving the rights of the sub-tenant or determining those rights, either immediately or after the landlord has complied with such requirements as may be specified. 7 The landlord or tenant of any land let on a short tenancy may at any time apply to the court to determine whether the land is or was at any time unfit by reason of war damage or any other question arising under this section in relation to the tenancy. 8 For the purposes of this section, a tenant shall not be deemed to be in occupation of any land which is unfit by reason of war damage by reason only\u2014 a that furniture or other goods belonging to or used by him remain on the land; b that he visits the land from time to time for the purpose of removing, or taking steps to preserve, any such furniture or goods; or c that he retains possession of the keys of any buildings or works situated on the land; and where the tenant has sub-let the whole or any part of the land, the occupation of the sub-tenant shall, as between the tenant and his landlord, be deemed to be the occupation of the tenant. 9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 In this section the following expressions have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say:\u2014 \u201c dwelling-house \u201d means a house of a part of a house let as a separate dwelling and does not exclude a house or part of a house so let by reason only that part of the premises is used as a shop or office or for business, trade or professional purposes; \u201c local authority \u201d means the Common Council of the City of London, the council of a   . . . borough   . . . or the council of a   . . . district; \u201c rent \u201d, in relation to any short tenancy, includes any periodical sum payable by the tenant to the landlord in connection with his tenancy, whether for services, lighting, heating, board, use of furniture, or otherwise, and references to rent payable under the tenanacy include references to any such sum contracted to be paid by any agreement; \u201c short tenancy \u201d means any tenancy or sub-tenancy which the tenant is entitled to dertermine at any time by a notice expiring not later than the end of the next complete quarter or the next complete period of three months of the tenancy, and, in a case where a person is holding over any land, which he previously held under a short tenancy, by virtue of the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts 1920 to 1939,  . . . or the Liabilities (War-Time Adjustment) Act 1941 he shall be deemed to be holding the land under a short tenancy."}, {"act": "Landlord and Tenant (War Damage) (Amendment) Act 1941", "year": 1941, "section": "2", "section_title": " Conditional notice of retention.", "section_text": "2 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 . . .section fifteen of the principal Act (which contains provisions as to the leases comprising two or more tenements) shall have effect as set out with modifications in the  . . .
