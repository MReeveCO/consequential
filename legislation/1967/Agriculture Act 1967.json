afforestation, and b shall be published and made available for inspection in such manner, and with such maps, plans and notes, as the Board consider appropriate, and the Board shall, in publishing

prepare or commission draft agreements, conveyances and other instruments and, by settling terms for inclusion in agreements for sale and other instruments or by drawing up a programme for the carrying out of the transactions, make arrangements for ensuring that the scheme, or any interdependent transactions, cannot be partly fulfilled and partly unfulfilled; and may carry out that and any
