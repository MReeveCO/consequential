any Measure of the National Assembly for Wales ; d they are satisfied that the institution is performing significantly less well than it might in all the circumstances reasonably be expected to perform, or is failing or likely to fail to give an acceptable standard of education or training. 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 If this section applies   the

the members of the institution\u2019s governing body; b appoint new members of that body if there are vacancies (however arising); c give to that body such directions as   they think   expedient as to the exercise of their powers and performance of their duties. 5A The directions that may be given to a governing body under this section include   \u2014                        a  a direction

a direction such as is mentioned in subsection (5A)(b) is given is to be taken for the purposes of section 27A(1) to have complied with section 27 before making the resolution required by the direction. 6 Directions may be given to a body under this section despite any enactment making the exercise of a power or performance of a duty contingent on the body\u2019s opinion. 6A The Welsh Ministers may not direct a governing body under subsection (5)(c) to dismiss a member of staff. 6B But subsection (6A) does not prevent the Welsh Ministers, where they consider that it may be appropriate to dismiss a member of staff whom the governing body have power under their institution's articles of government to dismiss, from giving the governing body such directions under this section as are necessary to secure that the procedures applicable to the consideration of the case for dismissal of that member of staff are given effect to in relation to that member of staff. 7 A governing body must comply with any directions given to them under this section. 8 An appointment of a member of a governing body under this section shall have effect as if made in accordance with the instrument of government and articles of government of the institution concerned. 9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."}, {"act": "Further and Higher Education Act 1992",
