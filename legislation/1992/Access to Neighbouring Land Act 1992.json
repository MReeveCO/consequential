and b that they cannot be carried out, or would be substantially more difficult to carry out, without entry upon the servient land; but this subsection is subject to subsection (3) below. 3 The court shall not make an access order in any case where it is satisfied that, were it to make such an order\u2014 a the respondent or any other person would suffer interference with, or disturbance of, his use or enjoyment of the servient land, or b the respondent, or any other person (whether of full age or capacity or not) in occupation of the whole or any part of the servient land, would suffer hardship, to such a degree by reason of the entry (notwithstanding any requirement of this Act or any term or condition that may be imposed under it) that it would be unreasonable to make the order. 4 Where the court is satisfied on an application under this section that it is reasonably necessary to carry out any basic preservation works to the dominant land, those works shall be taken for the purposes of this Act to be reasonably necessary for the preservation of the land; and in this subsection \u201c basic preservation works \u201d means any of the following, that is to say\u2014 a the maintenance, repair or renewal of any part of a building or other structure comprised in, or situate on, the dominant land; b the clearance, repair or renewal of any drain, sewer, pipe or cable so comprised or situate; c the treatment, cutting back, felling, removal or replacement of any hedge, tree, shrub or other growing thing which is so comprised and which is, or is in danger of becoming, damaged, diseased, dangerous, insecurely rooted or dead; d the filling in, or clearance, of any ditch so comprised; but this subsection is without prejudice to the generality of the works which may, apart from it, be regarded by the court as reasonably necessary for the preservation of any land. 5 If the court considers it fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, works may be regarded for the purposes of this Act as being reasonably necessary for the preservation of any land (or, for the purposes of subsection (4) above, as being basic preservation works which it is reasonably necessary to carry out to any land) notwithstanding that the works incidentally involve\u2014 a the making of some alteration, adjustment or improvement to the land, or b the demolition of the whole or any part of a building or structure comprised in or situate upon the land. 6 Where any works are reasonably necessary for the preservation of the whole or any part of the dominant land, the doing to the dominant land of anything which is requisite for, incidental to, or consequential on, the carrying out of those works shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as the carrying out of works which are reasonably necessary for the preservation of that land; and references in this Act to works, or to the carrying out of works, shall be construed accordingly. 7 Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (6) above, if it is reasonably necessary for a person to inspect the dominant land\u2014 a for the purpose of ascertaining whether any works may be reasonably necessary for the preservation of the whole or any part of that land, b for the purpose of making any map or plan, or ascertaining the course of any drain, sewer, pipe or cable, in preparation for, or otherwise in connection with, the carrying out of works which are so reasonably necessary, or c otherwise in connection with the carrying out of any such works, the making of such an inspection shall be taken for the purposes of this Act to be the carrying out to the dominant land of works which are reasonably necessary for the preservation of that land; and references in this Act to works, or to the carrying out of works, shall be construed accordingly."}, {"act": "Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992", "year": 1992, "section": "2", "section_title": " Terms and conditions of access orders.", "section_text": "2 1 An access order shall specify\u2014 a the works to the dominant land that may be carried out by entering upon the servient land in pursuance of the order; b the particular area of servient land that may be entered upon by virtue of the order for the purpose of carrying out those works to the dominant land; and c the date on which, or the period during which, the land may be so entered upon; and in the following provisions of this Act any reference to the servient land is a reference to the area specified in the order in pursuance of paragraph (b) above. 2 An access order may impose upon the applicant or the respondent such terms and conditions as appear to the court to be reasonably necessary for the purpose of avoiding or restricting\u2014 a any loss, damage, or injury which might otherwise be caused to the respondent or any other person by reason of the entry authorised by the order; or b any inconvenience or loss of privacy that might otherwise be so caused to the respondent or any other person. 3 Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2) above, the terms and conditions which may be imposed under that subsection include provisions with respect to\u2014 a the manner in which the specified works are to be carried out; b the days on which, and the hours between which, the work involved may be executed; c the persons who may undertake the carrying out of the specified works or enter upon the servient land under or by virtue of the order; d the taking of any such precautions by the applicant as may be specified in the order. 4 An access order may also impose terms and conditions\u2014 a requiring the applicant to pay, or to secure that such person connected with him as may be specified in the order pays, compensation for\u2014 i any loss, damage or injury, or ii any substantial loss of privacy or other substantial inconvenience, which will, or might, be caused to the respondent or any other person by reason of the entry authorised by the order;

and b the degree of inconvenience likely to be caused to the respondent or any other person by the entry; but no payment shall be ordered under this subsection if and to the extent that the works which the applicant desires to carry out by means of the entry are works to residential land. 6 For the purposes of subsection (5)(a) above, the likely financial advantage of an access order to the applicant and any persons connected with him shall in all cases be taken to be a sum of money equal to the greater of the following amounts, that is to say\u2014 a the amount (if any) by which so much of any likely increase in the value of any land\u2014 i which consists of or includes the dominant land, and ii which is owned or occupied by the same person as the dominant land, as may reasonably be regarded as attributable to the carrying out of the specified works exceeds the likely cost of carrying out those works with the benefit of the access order;

and ii the likely cost of carrying them out with the benefit of the access order. 7 For the purposes of subsection (5) above, \u201c residential land \u201d means so much of any land as consists of\u2014 a a dwelling or part of a dwelling; b a garden, yard, private garage or outbuilding which is used and enjoyed wholly or mainly with a dwelling; or c in the case of a building which includes one or more dwellings, any part of the building which is used and enjoyed wholly or mainly with those dwellings or any of them. 8 The persons who are to be regarded for the purposes of this section as \u201cconnected with\u201d the applicant are\u2014 a the owner of any estate or interest in, or right over, the whole or any part of the dominant land; b the occupier of the whole or any part of the dominant land; and c any person whom the applicant may authorise under section 3(7) below to exercise the power of entry conferred by the access order. 9 The court may make provision\u2014 a for the reimbursement by the applicant of any expenses reasonably incurred by the respondent in connection with the application which are not otherwise recoverable as costs; b for the giving of security by the applicant for any sum that might become payable to the respondent or any other person by virtue of this section or section 3 below."}, {"act": "Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992", "year": 1992, "section": "3", "section_title": " Effect of access order.", "section_text": "3 1 An access order requires the respondent, so far as he has power to do so, to permit the applicant or any of his associates to do anything which the applicant or associate is authorised or required to do under or by virtue of the order or this section. 2 Except as otherwise provided by or under this Act, an access order authorises the applicant or any of his associates, without the consent of the respondent,\u2014 a to enter upon the servient land for the purpose of carrying out the specified works; b to bring on to that land, leave there during the period permitted by the order and, before the end of that period, remove, such materials, plant and equipment as are reasonably necessary for the carrying out of those works; and c to bring on to that land any waste arising from the carrying out of those works, if it is reasonably necessary to do so in the course of removing it from the dominant land; but nothing in this Act or in any access order shall authorise the applicant or any of his associates to leave anything in, on or over the servient land (otherwise than in discharge of their duty to make good that land) after their entry for the purpose of carrying out works to the dominant land ceases to be authorised under or by virtue of the order. 3 An access order requires the applicant\u2014 a to secure that any waste arising from the carrying out of the specified works is removed from the servient land forthwith; b to secure that, before the entry ceases to be authorised under or by virtue of the order, the servient land is, so far as reasonably practicable, made good; and c to indemnify the respondent against any damage which may be caused to the servient land or any goods by the applicant or any of his associates which would not have been so caused had the order not been made;

or b any requirement that would otherwise be imposed by subsection (3) above. 5 Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (4) above, if the court is satisfied that it is reasonably necessary for any such waste as may arise from the carrying out of the specified works to be left on the servient land for some period before removal, the access order may, in place of subsection (3)(a) above, include provision\u2014 a authorising the waste to be left on that land for such period as may be permitted by the order; and b requiring the applicant to secure that the waste is removed before the end of that period. 6 Where the applicant or any of his associates is authorised or required under or by virtue of an access order or this section to enter, or do any other thing, upon the servient land, he shall not (as respects that access order) be taken to be a trespasser from the beginning on account of his, or any other person\u2019s, subsequent conduct. 7 For the purposes of this section, the applicant\u2019s \u201c associates \u201d are such number of persons (whether or not servants or agents of his) whom he may reasonably authorise under this subsection to exercise the power of entry conferred by the access order as may be reasonably necessary for carrying out the specified works."}, {"act": "Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992", "year": 1992, "section": "4", "section_title": " Persons bound by access order, unidentified persons and bar on contracting out.", "section_text": "4 1 In addition to the respondent, an access order shall, subject to the provisions of the  Land Charges Act 1972 and the  Land Registration Act 1925, be binding on\u2014 a any of his successors in title to the servient land;
