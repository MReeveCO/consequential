geographical area of that country exclusive of any land (or waters) to the seaward side of the high-water line along the coast of that country, including the coast of all islands comprised in that country. 4 For the purpose of subsection (3) above, section 108(5) of the  Finance Act 1986 (which provides a means of determining the high-water line at any place in the United Kingdom) shall, with any necessary modifications, apply to determine the high-water line at any place in a country other than the United Kingdom. 5 Except in so far as they have effect in relation to corporation tax or
