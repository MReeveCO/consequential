fall to be made in consequence, directly or indirectly, of a claim under section 165 or 260 in respect of an earlier disposal made by an individual (whether or not to the transferor), and c at any time during the clawback period,\u2014 i that individual has an interest in the settlement, or ii an arrangement subsists under which such an interest will or may be acquired by him. 4 If no claim for

relevant disposal, shall be treated for the purposes of tax in respect of chargeable gains as accruing to the transferor at the material time. 8 For any chargeable period ending after the making of the relevant disposal, the chargeable gains and allowable losses of\u2014 a the trustees of the settlement, or b any person whose title to any property to any extent derives, directly or indirectly, from them, shall be determined on the assumption that neither section 165(4)(b) nor section 260(3)(b) ever applied in relation to that disposal. 9 All such adjustments shall be made, whether by discharge or repayment of tax, the making of assessments or otherwise, as are required to give effect to subsection (8) above (notwithstanding any limitation on the time within which any adjustment may be made). 10 If a claim for relief under section 165 or 260 in respect of the relevant disposal is revoked, this section shall apply as if the claim had never been made. 11 In this section  \u201c the clawback period \u201d means the period\u2014 a beginning immediately after the making of the relevant disposal, and b ending six years after the end of the year of assessment in which that disposal was made. 12 In this section  \u201c the material time \u201d means the time at which subsection (1)(c) above first becomes satisfied. 13 This section is subject to section 169D."}, {"act":

assets where\u2014 a an individual makes a disposal of business assets (see subsection (2)), and b the disposal of business assets is a material disposal (see subsections (3) to (7)). 2 For the purposes of this Chapter a disposal of business assets is\u2014 a a disposal of the whole or part of a business, b a disposal of (or of interests in) one or more assets in use, at the time at which a business ceases to be carried on, for the purposes of the business, or c a disposal of one or more assets consisting of (or of interests in) shares in or securities of a company. 3 A disposal within paragraph (a) of subsection (2) is a material disposal if the business is owned by the individual throughout the period of   2 years   ending with the date of the disposal. 4 A disposal within paragraph (b) of that subsection is a material disposal if\u2014 a the business is owned by the individual throughout the period of   2 years   ending with the date on which the business ceases to be carried on, and b that date is within the period of 3 years ending with the date of the disposal. 5 A disposal within paragraph (c) of subsection (2) is a material disposal if condition A , B, C or D   is met. 6 Condition A is that, throughout the period of   2 years   ending with the date of the disposal\u2014 a the company is the individual's personal company and is either a trading company or the holding company of a trading group, and b the individual is an officer or employee of the company or (if the company is a member of a trading group) of one or more companies which are members of the trading group. 7 Condition B is that the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (6) are met throughout the period of   2 years   ending with the date on which the company\u2014 a ceases to be a trading company without continuing to be or becoming a member of a trading group, or b ceases to be a member of a trading group without continuing to be or becoming a trading company,

shares in the company to the individual following a relevant business transfer, and b any of the issued shares constitute, or otherwise form part of, the shares disposed of, the conditions in subsection (6)(a) and (b) are to be treated as met in any period ending immediately before the transfer throughout which the individual owned the business. 7ZB For the purposes of subsection (7ZA), shares have been issued  \u201cfollowing a relevant business transfer\u201d if they have been issued wholly or partly in exchange for the transfer of a business as a going concern, together with the

relevant EMI shares, or ii if at the time in question the individual is holding relevant EMI shares which are shares of another company, that other company.

is to be determined by reference to the date of the acquisition of the original relevant EMI shares. 7K Subject to what follows, in subsections (7A)(b) and (7B)(b)  \u201c the option grant date \u201d means the date on which the qualifying option in question was granted. 7L Subsections (7M) and (7N) apply if the qualifying option is a replacement option for the purposes of the EMI code (see paragraph 41 of Schedule 5 to  ITEPA  2003). 7M In subsections (7A)(b) and (7B)(b)  \u201c the option grant date \u201d means\u2014 a the date on which the old option was granted, or b if the old option was also a replacement option, the date on which the earlier old option was granted, and so on. 7N In relation to any time during the currency of an old option taken into account under subsection (7M), in subsection (7A)(c) references to the company are to be read as references to the company whose shares were the subject of the old option. 7O In subsection (7B)  \u201c the cessation date \u201d means the date on which the company\u2014 a ceases to be a trading company without continuing to be or becoming a member of a trading group, or b ceases to be a member of a trading group without continuing to be or becoming a trading company. 7P Subsections (7Q) and (7R) apply in relation to a disposal of relevant EMI shares if\u2014 a the shares were acquired as a result of the exercise of a qualifying option where\u2014 i a disqualifying event (see section 533 of  ITEPA  2003) occurs in relation to the option before its exercise, but ii it is exercised within the period mentioned in section 532(1)(b) of  ITEPA  2003, or b if the shares are relevant EMI shares by virtue of subsection (7F), the original relevant EMI shares were acquired as mentioned in paragraph (a). 7Q Subsection (7A)(b) has effect as if the reference to the date of the disposal were a reference to the date of the disqualifying event. 7R If the disqualifying event is within section 534(1)(c) of  ITEPA  2003, subsection (7B)(a) has effect as if the reference to the cessation date were a reference to the first day after the period mentioned in section 532(1)(b) of that Act if that day is later than the cessation date. 8 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a an individual who disposes of (or of interests in) assets used for the purposes of a business carried on by the individual on entering into a partnership which is to carry on the business is to be treated as disposing of a part of the business, b the disposal by an individual of the whole or part of the

A ceases to be a member of the second group, or ii (before sub-paragraph (i) applies) there ceases to be a connection between the two groups. 2AA Where this subsection applies\u2014 a in a case within subsection (2A)(d)(ii), for the purposes of this section (other than subsection (2A)) as it applies as respects the acquisition, company A and any associated company are to be treated as having ceased

unless subsection (2AB) applies. 2AB This subsection applies if company A's ceasing to be a member of the first group at the same time as one or more associated companies forms part of arrangements the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which is the avoidance of a liability to corporation tax. 2B For the purposes of subsection (2A) above there is a connection between the first group and the second group   at a particular time if, at that time, , the company which is the principal company of that group is under the control of\u2014 a the company which is the principal company of

at any time in that period, had under their   control either\u2014 i a company which would have   been a person falling   within paragraph (b) above if it had continued to exist, or ii a company which would have  been a person falling  within this paragraph (whether by reference to a company which would have  been a person falling  within that paragraph or to a company or series of companies falling within this sub-paragraph). 2C This section shall not have effect as respects any asset if, before the time when  company A  ceases to be a member of the group or, as the case may be, the second group, an event has already occurred by virtue of which the company falls by virtue of section 101A(3) to be treated as having sold and immediately reacquired the asset at the time specified in subsection (3) below. 2D This section shall not have effect as respects any asset if, before the time when  company A  ceases to be a member of the group or, as the case may be, the second group, an event has already occurred by virtue of which the company falls by virtue of section 101C(3) to be treated as having sold and immediately reacquired the asset at the time specified in subsection (3) below. 3 If, when  company A  ceases to be a member of the group,  company A , or an associated company also leaving the group, owns, otherwise than as trading stock\u2014 a the asset, or b property to which a chargeable gain has been carried forward from the asset on a replacement of business assets, then, subject to subsection (4) below,  company A  shall be treated for all the purposes of this Act as if immediately after its acquisition of the asset it had sold, and immediately reacquired, the asset at market value at that time. 3A Any chargeable gain or allowable loss which would otherwise accrue to company A on the sale referred to in subsection (3) does not so accrue if\u2014 a company A ceases to be a member of the group in consequence of\u2014 i a disposal of shares in company A or another member of the group made by a member of the group, or ii two or more such disposals, b either\u2014 i subsection (3B) applies to the disposal or, if there is more than one disposal, to at least one of them, or ii sub-paragraph (i) does not apply but had subsection (3B) applied to the disposal or, if there is more than one disposal, to each of them, any gain arising on the disposal or disposals would not have been a chargeable gain by virtue of Schedule 7AC, and c in the absence of this subsection, section 535 of CTA 2010 ( UK  REITS: exemption of gains) would not apply to the chargeable gain or allowable loss which would accrue to company A on the sale. 3B This subsection applies to a disposal of shares if\u2014 a the company making the disposal is resident in the United Kingdom at the time of the disposal, b the shares are chargeable assets in relation to that company immediately before that time, or c any part of the chargeable gain or allowable loss accruing on the disposal is treated as a gain or loss accruing to a person by virtue of   section 3   (attribution of gains to members of non-resident companies). In this section  \u201c group disposal \u201d means a disposal within subsection (3A)(a) to which this subsection applies and the company making the disposal is referred to as  \u201c the transferor company \u201d. 3C For the purposes of subsections (3A) and (3B), the question whether there is a disposal is to be determined ignoring section 127 (share reorganisations  etc  treated as not involving disposal). 3D If subsection (3A) applies, any chargeable gain or allowable loss accruing to the transferor company on a group disposal (other than a group disposal to which section 127 applies) is to be calculated\u2014 a where a chargeable gain would accrue to company A in the absence of subsection (3A), as if the amount of the consideration for the group disposal were increased by the amount of the gain, and b where an allowable loss would accrue to company A in the absence of subsection (3A), as if an amount equal to the amount of the loss were a sum allowable under section 38 as a deduction in the computation of the gain or loss accruing on the group disposal. 3E If subsection (3A) applies, and section 127 applies to a group disposal, any chargeable gain or allowable loss accruing to the transferor company on a disposal of the new holding arising from the group disposal (or any part of that holding) is to be calculated\u2014 a where a chargeable gain would accrue to company A in the absence of subsection (3A)\u2014 i as if an amount equal to the amount of the gain were excluded from the expenditure allowable as a deduction under section 38 in the computation of the gain or loss accruing on the disposal (but not so as to reduce that expenditure below nil), and ii where (ignoring sub-paragraph (i)) the amount of the gain exceeds the expenditure allowable as such a deduction, as if a gain equal to that excess accrued on the disposal of the new holding (or, if the disposal is of a part of the new holding, a gain equal to the corresponding part of that excess accrued on that disposal), in addition to any gain or loss that actually accrues on the disposal of the new holding or part, and b where an allowable loss would accrue to company A in the absence of subsection (3A), as if an amount equal to the amount of the loss were a sum allowable under section 38 as a deduction in the computation of the gain or loss accruing on the disposal. In this subsection  \u201c new holding \u201d has the meaning given by section 126. 3F If there is more than one group disposal, the references in subsections (3D) and (3E) to the amount of the gain or loss which would accrue to company A in the absence of subsection (3A) are to be read, in relation to each disposal, as references to\u2014 a such proportion of that amount as the transferor companies in relation to the group disposals jointly elect as the appropriate proportion in relation to the disposal in question, or b where no election is made, the proportion of that amount attributable to that disposal if that amount is divided equally between the group disposals. 3G An election under subsection (3F) must\u2014 a specify the appropriate proportion in relation to each group disposal, and b be made, by notice to an officer of Revenue and Customs, no later than 2 years after the end of the first accounting period of a company in which any chargeable gain or allowable loss on a group disposal accrues. 3H If a group disposal by a company consists of shares of more than one class, then, for the purposes of subsections (3D) and (3E), the company may apportion any increase or deduction to be made between the classes of shares in such manner as it considers appropriate. 4 Any chargeable gain or allowable loss   accruing   to   company A   on the sale referred to in subsection (3) above shall be treated as accruing to  company A   at whichever is the later of the following, that is to say\u2014 a the time immediately after the beginning of the accounting period of that company in which or, as the case may be, at the end of which the company ceases to be a member of the group; and b the time when under subsection (3) above it is treated as having reacquired the asset;   and sections 138 to 142 of CTA 2010 have effect accordingly as if the actual circumstances were as they are treated as having been . 5 Subsections (6) to (8) apply where\u2014 a in the absence of subsection (6), company A would be treated by virtue of subsection (3) as selling an asset at any time, by reason of ceasing to be a member of the group, and b company A ceases to be a member of the group by reason only of the fact that the principal company of that group becomes a member of another group. 6   Subsection (3) does not apply to treat company A as selling the asset at that time; but   if\u2014 a within 6 years of that time   company A   ceases at any time (\u201c the relevant time \u201d) to satisfy the following conditions, and b at the relevant time,  company A , or a company in the same group as that company, owns otherwise than as trading stock the asset or property to which a chargeable gain has been carried forward from the asset on a replacement of business assets, company A  shall be treated for all the purposes of this Act as if, immediately after its acquisition of the asset, it had sold and immediately reacquired the asset at the value that, at the time of acquisition, was its market value. 7 Those conditions are\u2014 a that   company A   is a 75 per cent. subsidiary of one or more members of the other group referred to in subsection (5) above, and b that  company A  is an effective 51 per cent. subsidiary of one or more of those members. 7A Any chargeable gain or allowable loss which would otherwise accrue to company A on the sale referred to in subsection (6) does not so accrue if\u2014 a company A ceases at the relevant time to satisfy the conditions in subsection (7) in consequence of\u2014 i a disposal of shares in company A, or another member of the other group mentioned in subsection (5)(b), made by a member of that other group, or ii two or more such disposals, b either\u2014 i subsection (3B) applies to the disposal or, if there is more than one disposal, to at least one of them, or ii sub-paragraph (i) does not apply but had subsection (3B) applied to the disposal or, if there is more than one disposal, to each of them, any gain arising on the disposal or disposals would not have been a chargeable gain by virtue of Schedule 7AC, and c in the absence of this subsection, section 535 of CTA 2010 ( UK  REITS: exemption of gains) would not apply to the chargeable gain or allowable loss which would accrue to company A on the sale. 7B Where subsection (7A) applies, subsections (3C) to (3H) apply to the calculation of any chargeable gain or allowable loss accruing on a disposal within subsection (7A)(a) to which subsection (3B) applies (a  \u201crelevant disposal\u201d) with the following modifications\u2014 a in subsections (3C) to (3H) for the references to a group disposal substitute references to a relevant disposal, and b in subsections (3C), (3D) and (3E) for the references to subsection (3A) substitute references to subsection (7A). 8 Any chargeable gain or allowable loss accruing to   company A on the sale referred to in subsection (6) is to be treated as accruing immediately before the relevant time.   9 Where\u2014 a by virtue of this section a company is treated as having sold an asset at any time, and b if at that time the company had in fact sold the asset at market value at that time, then, by virtue of section 30  or 31 , any allowable loss or chargeable gain accruing on the disposal would have been calculated as if the consideration for the disposal were increased by an amount, subsections (3) and (6) above shall have effect as if the market value at that time had been that amount greater. 9A   Sections 450 and 451 of CTA 2010   (meaning of control) shall have effect for the purposes of subsection (2B) above as   they have   effect for the purposes of   Part 10 of CTA 2010 ; but a person carrying on a business of banking shall not for the purposes of that subsection be regarded as having control of any company by reason only of having, or of the consequences of having exercised, any rights of that person in respect of loan capital or debt issued or incurred by the company for money lent by that person to the company in the ordinary course of that business. 10 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a two companies are associated with each other if one is a 75 per cent subsidiary of the other or both are 75 per cent subsidiaries of another company , b a chargeable gain is carried forward from an asset to other property on a replacement of business assets if, by one or more claims under sections 152 to 158, the chargeable gain accruing on a disposal of the asset is reduced, and as a result an amount falls to be deducted from the expenditure allowable in computing a gain accruing on the disposal of the other property, c an asset acquired by   company A   shall be treated as the same as an asset owned at a later time by that company or an associated company if the value of the second asset is derived in whole or in part from the first asset, and in particular where the second asset is a freehold, and the first asset was a leasehold and the lessee has acquired the reversion. 10A For the purposes of this section an asset is a  \u201c chargeable asset \u201d in relation to a company at any time if any gain accruing to the company on a disposal of the asset by the company at that time\u2014 a would be a chargeable gain   chargeable to corporation tax as a result of section 2B(3) or (4),   or b would, but for Schedule 7AC (exemptions for disposals by companies with substantial shareholdings), be within paragraph (a). 11 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 . . . . . . . .

rights) the rights, the interest or any interest from which the interest directly or indirectly derives (in whole or in part), have or has at any time been acquired by any person for actual

accounting period exceed the non-BLAGAB chargeable gains so accruing. 3 BLAGAB allowable losses accruing to an insurance company are allowable as a deduction from non-BLAGAB chargeable gains accruing to the company as permitted by the following provisions of this section (and not otherwise). 4 They are allowable as a deduction from only so much of non-BLAGAB chargeable gains accruing to the

to an insurance company in an accounting period is determined as follows. 10A If the company has an I - E profit for the accounting period\u2014 a find the percentage (including, if applicable, nil) of the I - E profit that is not represented by the policyholders' share of that profit as determined in accordance with section 103 of the Finance Act 2012, and b then multiply that percentage by the

The result is the shareholder's share of the BLAGAB chargeable gains or BLAGAB allowable losses. 10B If the company does not have an I - E profit for the accounting period, the shareholders' share of
