structure of commercial assets and when an advance may, for those purposes, be treated partly as a class 1 advance and partly as a class 2 advance. 2 Class 1 advances are advances as to which the society when it makes the advance is satisfied that the advance is an advance secured on land and that\u2014 a the borrower is an individual; b where the advance is not an advance secured on third party land, the land is for the residential use of the borrower or a dependant of his of a prescribed description; ba where the advance is an advance secured on third party land\u2014 i the borrower intends that the advance will be used for the purpose of acquiring land for the residential use of himself or a dependant of his of a prescribed description; and ii the land on which the advance is secured is for the residential use of the mortgagor or a dependant of his of a prescribed description; c the amount advanced will not exceed the value of the basic security (after deducting from that value any   outstanding amount secured by a mortgage of the land in favour of the society) ; and d subject to subsection (5) below, no other mortgage of the land which is to secure the advance is outstanding in favour of a person other than the society; and which are not made on terms as respects the capital element of the mortgage debt authorised by section 10(10)(b) or (c). 3 Subject to any order made under section 12(1), a the requirement in subsection (2)(b) above shall be treated as satisfied if no less than 40 per cent. of the area of the land is used for the residential purposes by the borrower or a dependant of his of a prescribed description; b the requirement in subsection (2)(ba)(i) above shall be treated as satisfied if the borrower intends that no less than 40 per cent. of the area of the land will be for the residential use of himself or a dependant of his of a prescribed description; and c the requirement in subsection (2)(ba)(ii) above shall be treated as satisfied if no less than 40 per cent. of the area of the land is used for residential purposes by the mortgagor or a dependant of his of a prescribed description. 4 Class 2 advances are advances as to which the society when it makes the advance\u2014 a either is not satisfied that the requirements for the time being of subsection (2) above are fulfilled or is satisfied that any of them is not fulfilled, but b is satisfied that the advance is an advance secured on land, and c is satisfied, where the amount advanced will exceed the value of the basic security (after deducting from that value any   outstanding amount secured by a mortgage of the land) , that the excess will be secured by the taking of security of a prescribed description in addition to the basic security, and d is satisfied that no, or no more than one, other mortgage of the land which is to secure the advance is outstanding in favour of a person other than the society. 5 The requirement in subsection (2)(d) and (4)(d) above shall be treated as satisfied if the advance is made on terms that the other mortgage is redeemed or postponed to the basic security. 6 An advance for a deposit for the purchase of land is also a class 1 or class 2 advance according as it is made with a view to the making of a class 1 or class 2 advance secured on the land. 7 Advances which would be class 2, and not class 1, advances by reason only that the extent of the residential use of the land is not such as to satisfy the requirement in subsection (2)(b)\t\t\t\t\t  or (2)(ba)(i) or (ii)  above shall be treated as class 1 advances if

assets, and b class 2 advances constitute class 2 assets, and accordingly the aggregate amount of mortgage debts outstanding in respect of class 2 advances counts in accordance with section 20 towards the limit applicable to class 2 assets under that section. 9 For the purposes of subsections (2) and (4) above, where a building society makes an advance by instalments, any reference to the time when the society makes the advance is a reference to the time when it pays the first of the instalments, disregarding for this purpose any instalment which is to be applied towards payment of the deposit in respect of the purchase of the land which is to secure the advance. 10 Subject to subsection (11) below, any land to which a building society becomes absolutely entitled by foreclosure or by release or other extinguishment of a right of redemption\u2014 a shall as soon as may be conveniently practicable be sold or converted into money; and b shall, until the sale or conversion, constitute a class 1 asset if the advance secured on the land was a class 1 advance and a class 2 asset if it was a class 2 advance. 11 Where a building society which has for the time being adopted the powers conferred by section 17 becomes entitled to land as mentioned in subsection (10) above, and the land is land that may be held under that section, then, if the society\u2014 a elects to hold the land under that section, or b without such an election, retains the land after the expiry of the period of twelve months immediately following the date on which it so becomes entitled to the land. the society shall be taken to hold the land under that section. 12 An election under subsection (11) above shall be made by resolution of the board of directors and shall be irrevocable. 13 If a building society contravenes subsection (10) above the society shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale and so shall any officer who is also guilty of the offence. 14 For the purposes of this Act, the mortgage debt at any time, in relation to an advance secured on land, is the total amount outstanding at that time in respect of\u2014 a the principal of the advance; b interest on the advance; and c any other sum which the borrower is obliged to pay the society under the terms of the advance. 15 The reference in subsection (10) above to land to which

its powers. 6 If it appears to the Commission at any time that a building society or its subsidiary is carrying on or is about to carry on an activity which is or may be outside the existing powers of the society, the Commission may, by notice to the society specifying the activity and its opinion, direct it to make an application for a determination under this section whether the activity is or is not within its powers and it shall be the duty of the society to comply with the direction. 7 A direction under subsection (6) shall require the application to be made within the period of 21 days beginning with the date on which the notice is given, but the Commission may extend or further extend the period within which the application is to be made. 8 If a building society fails, within the time allowed by or under subsection (7) above, to make an application as directed under subsection (6) above, the Commission may, of its own motion, proceed to make a determination under this section as if an application had been made by the society. 9 An application by a building society under subsection (4), (5) or (6) above shall be made in writing, signed by the secretary as such an application, and shall comprise\u2014 a a statement of the question for determination, specifying the activity and the powers in question, the nature of the doubt and (except in the case of an application under subsection (6)) the arguments for and against the activity being within those powers, as they appear to the society, and b such documents or draft documents and such other information as are necessary to enable the determination to be made. 10 The statement of the question for determination may, with the agreement of the Commission, be amended at any time before the determination is made and in that event further documents and other information may be included in the application. 11 The Commission may, by notice to the society, require a society making an application under subsection (4), (5) or (6) above to amend the statement of the question for determination or to furnish such further documents or other information or such explanations of the statement, documents or information as appear to it to be necessary to enable the determination of the question to be made; and the Commission may allow or require the explanations to be made orally instead of in writing. 12 In this section and sections 39 and 40\u2014 \u201c activity \u201d includes the exercise, or purported exercise, of any power under this Act, including the holding of any property or rights; \u201c existing \u201d, with reference to powers, means existing at the relevant date and, in relation to a building society, \u201c existing powers \u201d denotes the powers it has, or has adopted, under this Act, with any restrictions it has assumed, as at that date but disregarding anything done by the Commission and then in force (otherwise than under section 39 or 40) by virtue of which the society is precluded from exercising, or is subject to restrictions on the exercise of, its powers; \u201c the relevant date \u201d, in relation to a building society, means\u2014 a in a case where the Commission decides to proceed of its own motion, the date when the Commission so decides; b in a case where the society makes the application at the direction of the central office, the date specified in the direction; and c in any other case, the date on which the society makes the application. 13 Nothing in this section or section 39 or 40 implies that it is improper for the Commission to give to a building society or building societies generally an indication of the action it might or might not take in relation to any proposed activity of theirs; and if any determination comes to be made in relation to the activity the proceedings shall not be liable to be set aside by reason of the indication having been given."}, {"act": "Building Societies Act 1986",

whose only interest is as a shareholder in, or depositor with, the society. 3 Subject to subsection (4) below, the Commission shall, within the period of one month beginning with the date of the notice to the society under subsection (1) above, publish the determination in such manner as it thinks appropriate. 4 Where the determination is made on an application made by the society under section 38(4), the Commission may, on the application of the society, postpone the publication of the determination for such period as it thinks fit, not exceeding the period of six months beginning with the date of the notice to the society under subsection (1) above, if it appears to the Commission that it is just to do so. 5 A determination under section 38 shall bind all persons, whether or not (in the case of an application) they were parties to it and, subject to any appeal under subsection (8) below, shall be final and conclusive for all purposes. 6 Where the activity in question was

consequent on the order). 7 If it appears to the Commission that proceedings under subsection (6) above have not been, but ought in the interests of the society to be, brought, the Commission may bring such proceedings in the name and on behalf of the society; and if it does so the Commission may indemnify the society against the costs or expenses incurred by the society in, or in connection with, proceedings brought by virtue of this subsection. 8 Any person affected by a determination under section 38 shall be entitled within the period of six weeks beginning with the date of the notice

prohibition order is made under this section, may be carried on by the society. serve on the society a notice of the Commission\u2019s intention to issue a prohibition order directed to the society. 2 A prohibition order under this section is an order prohibiting, subject to the saving or transitional provisions of the order, the continuance or, as the case may be, the carrying on of the activity specified in the order, either absolutely or unless conditions specified in the order are complied with, after a date specified in the order and requiring, subject to the saving or transitional provisions of the order, the disposal within a specified period of all assets acquired or otherwise in its possession by virtue of the activity. 3 A disposal of assets in pursuance of a prohibition order shall vest the assets in the transferee but without prejudice to any claim against the society by a person who had an interest in the assets. 4 The saving or transitional provisions which may be included in a prohibition order shall be such as appear to the Commission to be just having regard to the interests of shareholders of and the depositors with the society and the interests of other persons who will be affected by the order; but the provisions shall not in any respect suspend the operation of the order beyond the period of one year. 5 A prohibition order may include a direction

subsection (1) above of the Commission\u2019s intention to issue a prohibition order shall\u2014 a specify the date on which the order is to be issued, being a date not earlier than the end of the period of 21 days beginning with the date of the notice; b specify the terms of the order, including any saving or transitional provisions proposed to be included in it; c inform the society of its right to make representations to the Commission before the order is issued as to the saving or transitional provisions to be included in the order; and d inform the society of its duty under subsection (7) below. 7 On receiving a notice under subsection (1) above the society shall forthwith send a copy of it to every other person whom it has reason to believe will or may be affected by the determination under section 38 on which the order will be founded. 8 Any person who may be affected by the determination under section 38 on which the order will be founded may, at any time before the order is made, make representations to the Commission as to the inclusion in it of saving or transitional provisions affecting his interests and they may be made orally or in writing. 9 After considering any representations made under subsection (8) above the Commission shall make the prohibition order with such saving and transitionalprovisions (if any) as it thinks just, shall issue the order by causing it to be served on the society and shall direct the central office to keep a copy of it in the public file of the society. 10 A prohibition order so made and issued shall, subject to subsection (15) below, take effect on the date specified in the order. 11 A copy of any order issued under subsection (9) above shall also be served on each director and on the chief executive of the society. 12 The requirement of subsection (11) above, so far as it relates to directors, is satisfied by serving a copy on each director whose appointment has been officially notified and the non-receipt of a copy by a director or the chief executive does not affect the validity of the direction. 13 Subject to subsection (14) below, a prohibition order shall remain in force until revoked by the Commission. 14 The Commission may suspend or revoke a prohibition order so far as it relates to an asset the disposal of which appears to it, on the application of the society, to be impracticable. 15 If, when a prohibition order has been made, an appeal is pending before the High Court under section 39(8) against the determination on which the order is founded the High Court may, on application made to it, order that the operation of the prohibition order be stayed until the determination of the appeal; but it shall not do so unless it is satisfied that it is in the public interest that it be stayed. 16 If a society contravenes a prohibition order issued against it under this section the Commission may certify the contravention in writing to the High Court; and the Court may thereupon inquire into the case and, after hearing any witnesses who may be produced against or on behalf of the society and after hearing any statement which may be offered in defence, may punish the society in like manner as if it had been guilty of contempt of the court. 17 In the application of this section to a building society whose principal office is in Scotland, references to the High Court shall be read as references to the Court of Session and references to staying shall be read as references to sisting."}, {"act": "Building Societies Act 1986", "year": 1986, "section":

is the duty of all officers and agents of the body under investigation\u2014 a to produce to the inspectors all documents and material of or relating to the body under investigation which are in their custody or power; b to attend before the inspectors when required to do so, and c otherwise to give the inspectors all assistance in connection with the investigation which they are reasonably able to give. 3 If the inspectors consider that a person other than an officer or agent of the body under investigation is or may be in possession of information concerning its affairs, they may require that person to produce to them any documents or material in his custody or power relating to the body under investigation, to attend before them and otherwise to give them all assistance in connection with the investigation which he is reasonably able to give; and it is that person\u2019s duty to comply with the requirement. 4 The inspectors may examine on oath the officers and agents of the body under investigation, and any such person as is mentioned in subsection (3) above, in relation to the affairs of the body under investigation, and may administer an oath accordingly. 5 An answer given by a person to a question put to him under the foregoing provisions of this section may be used in evidence against him. 5A However, in criminal proceedings in which that person is charged with an offence to which this subsection applies\u2014 a no evidence relating to the answer may be adduced, and b no question relating to it may be asked, by or on behalf of the prosecution, unless evidence relating to it is adduced, or a question relating to it is asked, in the proceedings by or on behalf of that person. 5B Subsection (5A) above applies to any offence other than\u2014 a an offence under section 2 or 5 of the Perjury Act 1911 (false statements made on oath otherwise than in judicial proceedings or made otherwise than on oath); b an offence under section 44(1) or (2) of the Criminal Law (Consolidation)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Scotland) Act 1995 (false statements made on oath or otherwise than on oath); or c an offence under Article 7 or 10 of the   Perjury (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 (false statements made on oath otherwise than in judicial proceedings or made otherwise than on oath). 6 If an officer or agent of the body under investigation or any such person as is mentioned in subsection (3) above\u2014 a refuses to produce any document or material which it is his duty under this section to produce, or b refuses to attend before the inspectors when required to do so, or c refuses to answer any question put to him by the inspectors with respect to the affairs of the body under investigation, the inspectors may certify the refusal in writing to the High Court; and the court may thereupon inquire into the case and, after hearing any witnesses who may be produced against or on behalf of the alleged offender and after hearing any statement which may be offered in defence, may punish the offender in like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of the court. 7 The inspectors may, and if so directed by the   body which appointed the inspectors   shall, make interim reports to the   body which appointed the inspectors  , but they may at any time in the course of the investigation, without making an interim report, inform the   body which appointed the inspectors   of matters coming to their knowledge as a result of the investigation tending to show that an offence has been committed. 8 The   body which appointed the inspectors   may, if it thinks fit\u2014 a send a copy of any report made by the inspectors to the body whose affairs are or were the subject of the investigation; b furnish a copy of any such report on request  . . . to\u2014 i any member of the body whose affairs are or were the subject of the investigation; ii the auditors of that body; iii any person whose conduct is referred to in the report; iv any other person whose financial interests appear to the   body which appointed the inspectors   to be affected by matters dealt with in the report, whether as creditor or otherwise; and c cause the report to be printed and published. 8A The   body which appointed the inspectors   may charge a reasonable fee for furnishing to any person a copy of a report under subsection (8)(b) above. 9 A copy of a report of inspectors appointed under section 56 to hold an investigation under that section, certified by the   body which appointed the inspectors   to be a true copy, is admissable in any legal proceedings as evidence of the opinion of the inspectors in relation to any matter contained in the report; and a document purporting to be such a certificate shall be received in evidence and be deemed to be such a certificate, unless the contrary is proved. 10 The   body which appointed the inspectors   shall be entitled to be repaid the expenses of the investigation defrayed by it under section 56(6)(d) as provided in the following paragraphs, that is to say\u2014 a by the applicants for the investigation, to such extent (if any) as the   body which appointed the inspectors   may direct; c by any person convicted of an offence in proceedings instituted as a result of the investigation, to such extent (if any) as the court by or before which he was convicted may order; and a person liable under any one of paragraphs (a) to (c) above is entitled to contribution from any other person liable under the same paragraph, according to the amount of their respective liabilities under it. 11 In the application of this section to a building society whose principal office is in Scotland, any reference to the High Court shall be read as a reference to the Court of Session."}, {"act": "Building
