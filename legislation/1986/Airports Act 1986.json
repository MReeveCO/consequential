(and has not withdrawn the application), b the airport operator pays the charge (if any) specified in a scheme or regulations made under section 11 of the 1982 Act, and c the  CAA  considers that, at the time, the airport is an eligible airport. 4 An airport is an eligible airport if\u2014 a the annual turnover of the business carried on at the airport by the airport operator exceeded \u00a31

withdrawing a certificate in respect of an airport, the appropriate Minister must consult\u2014 a the  CAA , and b the airport operator. 8 The withdrawal of a certificate does not affect any rights or liabilities accruing by virtue of this Part before it is withdrawn. 9 In this section\u2014 \u201c annual turnover \u201d, in relation to the business carried on at an airport by the airport operator,

council \u201d have the same meaning as in Part 2. 10 Where the person who is for the time being the airport operator in relation to an airport has not had its management for the whole or any part of a period relevant for the purposes of this section, references in this section to the business carried on at the airport by the airport operator include a reference to the business carried on there by
