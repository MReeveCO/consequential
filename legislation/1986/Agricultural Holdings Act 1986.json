agricultural tenancy if, having regard to\u2014 a the terms of the tenancy, b the actual or contemplated use of the land at the time of the conclusion of the contract and subsequently, and c any other relevant circumstances, the whole of the land comprised in the contract, subject to such exceptions only as do not substantially affect the character of the tenancy, is let for use as agricultural land. 3 A change in user of the land concerned subsequent to the conclusion of a contract of tenancy which involves any breach of the terms of the tenancy shall be disregarded for the purpose of
