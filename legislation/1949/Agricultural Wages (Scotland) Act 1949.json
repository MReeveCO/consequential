In the exercise of their powers under this subsection, the Board shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, secure a weekly half-holiday for workers. 5 An order under this section shall have effect as regards any terms as to remuneration from a date specified in the order, which may be a date earlier than the date of the order but not earlier than the date on which the Board agreed on those terms prior to publishing (in accordance with Schedule 3 to this Act) the original proposals to which effect is given, with or without modifications, by the order. 6 Any increase in wages payable by virtue of an order under this section in respect of any time before the date of the order (hereafter in this Act referred to as arrears of wages) shall be paid by the employer within a period specified in the order being\u2014 a in the case of a worker who is in the employment of the employer on that date, a period begining with that date;
