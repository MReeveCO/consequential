Liability to make payments 171ZM 1 The liability to make payments of statutory adoption pay is a liability of any person of whom the person entitled to the payments has been an employee as mentioned in section 171ZL(2)(b) above. 2 Regulations shall make provision as to a former employer\u2019s liability to pay statutory adoption pay to a person in any case where the former employee\u2019s contract of service with him has been brought to an end by the former employer solely, or mainly, for the purpose of avoiding liability for statutory adoption pay. 3 The Secretary of State may, with the concurrence of the Board, by regulations specify circumstances in which, notwithstanding this section, liability to make payments of statutory adoption pay is to be a liability of the Board.  Rate and period of pay 171ZN 1 Statutory adoption pay shall be payable at such fixed or earnings-related weekly rate as the Secretary of State may prescribe by regulations, which may prescribe different kinds of rate for different cases. 2 Statutory adoption pay shall be payable, subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, in respect of each week during a prescribed period (\u201c the adoption pay period \u201d) of a duration not exceeding 26 weeks. 3 A person shall not be liable to pay statutory adoption pay to another in respect of any week during any part of which the other works under a contract of service with him. 4 It is immaterial for the purposes of subsection (3) above whether the work referred to in that subsection is work under a contract of service which existed immediately before the adoption pay period or a contract of service which did not so exist. 5 Except in such cases as may be prescribed, statutory adoption pay shall not be payable to a person in respect of any week during any part of which he works for any employer who is not liable to pay him statutory adoption pay. 6 The Secretary of State may by regulations specify circumstances in which there is to be no liability to pay statutory adoption pay in respect of a week. 7 In subsection (2) above, \u201c week \u201d means any period of seven days. 8 In subsections (3), (5) and (6) above, \u201c week \u201d means a period of seven days beginning with the day of the week on which the adoption pay period begins.  Restrictions on contracting out 171ZO 1 Any agreement shall be void to the extent that it purports\u2014 a to exclude, limit or otherwise modify any provision of this Part of this Act, or b to require an employee or former employee to contribute (whether directly or indirectly) towards any costs incurred by his employer or former employer under this Part of this Act. 2 For the avoidance of doubt, any agreement between an employer and an employee authorising any deductions from statutory adoption pay which the employer is liable to pay to the employee in respect of any period shall not be void by virtue of subsection (1)(a) above if the employer\u2014 a is authorised by that or another agreement to make the same deductions from any contractual remuneration which he is liable to pay in respect of the same period, or b would be so authorised if he were liable to pay contractual remuneration in respect of that period.  Relationship with benefits and other payments  etc 171ZP 1 Except as may be prescribed, a day which falls within the adoption pay period shall not be treated as a day of incapacity for work for the purposes of determining, for this Act, whether it forms part of a period of incapacity for work for the purposes of incapacity benefit. 2 Regulations may provide that in prescribed circumstances a day which falls within the adoption pay period shall be treated as a day of incapacity for work for the purposes of determining entitlement to the higher rate of short-term incapacity benefit or to long-term incapacity benefit. 3 Regulations may provide that an amount equal to a person\u2019s statutory adoption pay for a period shall be deducted from any such benefit in respect of the same period and a person shall be entitled to such benefit only if there is a balance after the deduction and, if there is such a balance, at a weekly rate equal to it. 4 Subject to subsections (5) and (6) below, any entitlement to statutory adoption pay shall not affect any right of a person in relation to remuneration under any contract of service (\u201c contractual remuneration \u201d). 5 Subject to subsection (6) below\u2014 a any contractual remuneration paid to a person by an employer of his in respect of a week in the adoption pay period shall go towards discharging any liability of that employer to pay statutory adoption pay to him in respect of that week; and b any statutory adoption pay paid by an employer to a person who is an employee of his in respect of a week in the adoption pay period shall go towards discharging any liability of that employer to pay contractual remuneration to him in respect of that week. 6 Regulations may make provision as to payments which are, and those which are not, to be treated as contractual remuneration for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) above. 7 In subsection (5) above, \u201c week \u201d means a period of seven days beginning with the day of the week on which the adoption pay period begins.
