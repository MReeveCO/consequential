discretion on the Secretary of State or an immigration officer. 2I Regulations under subsection  (2F)  or  (2G) \u2014 a may make different provision for different purposes; b may make consequential, supplementary, incidental, transitional or saving provision; c must be made by statutory instrument. 2J A person who may be detained under subsection  (2A)  may no longer be detained under subsection

same meaning as in the Illegal Migration Act 2023 (see section  4  of that Act). 2N A person liable to be detained under this section may be detained for such period as, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, is reasonably necessary to enable the decision to be made, the removal or examination to be carried out, or the directions to be given. 2O Subsections (1) to (2A) apply regardless of whether there is anything that for the time being prevents the decision from being made, the removal or examination from being carried out, or the directions from being given. 2P Subsections  (2N)  and  (2O)  are subject to\u2014 a paragraph 18B of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 (limitation on detention of unaccompanied children), as applied by subsection (3); b subsections  (2B)  to  (2E)  (limitation on detention of pregnant women); c subsection (7A) and section 60 of the Immigration Act 2016 (limitation on detention of pregnant women). 2Q Subsection  (2R)  applies if, while a

a reasonable period of time. 2R The person may be detained under this section for such further period as, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, is reasonably necessary to enable such arrangements to be made for the person\u2019s release as the Secretary of State considers to be appropriate. 3 A provision of Schedule 2 to that Act about a person who is detained or liable to detention under that
