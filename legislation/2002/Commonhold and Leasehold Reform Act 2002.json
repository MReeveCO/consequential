is payable only to the extent that the amount of the charge is reasonable; and \u201c variable estate charge \u201d means an estate charge which is neither\u2014 a specified in the scheme, nor b calculated in accordance with a formula specified in the scheme. 3 Any person on whom an obligation to pay an estate charge is imposed by the scheme may apply to   the appropriate tribunal   for an order varying the scheme in such manner as is specified in the application on the grounds that\u2014 a any estate charge specified in the scheme is unreasonable, or b any formula specified in the scheme in accordance with which any estate charge is calculated is unreasonable. 4 If the grounds on which the application was made are established to the satisfaction of the tribunal, it may make an order varying the scheme in such manner as is specified in the order. 5 The variation specified in the order may be\u2014 a the variation specified in the application, or b such other variation as the tribunal thinks fit. 6 An application may be made to   the appropriate tribunal   for a determination whether an estate charge is payable by a person and, if it is, as to\u2014 a the person by whom it is payable, b the person to whom it is payable, c the amount which is payable, d the date at or by which it is payable, and e the manner in which it is payable. 7 Subsection (6) applies whether or not

the matter. 9 No application under subsection (6) may be made in respect of a matter which\u2014 a has been agreed or admitted by the person concerned, b has been, or is to be, referred to arbitration
