shall make such provision (either by insurance or by some other means) as  the appropriate authority  may with the consent of the Treasury approve for sufficient funds to be available at all times to ensure that any claims which have been or may be duly established against the licensee as licensee of that site by virtue of section 7 of this Act or any relevant foreign law made for purposes corresponding to those of section 10 of this Act (excluding, but without prejudice to, any claim in respect of interest or costs) are satisfied up to  the required amount   appropriate to the category or categories into which any such claims would fall  in respect of each severally of the following periods, that is to say\u2014 a the current cover period, if any; b any cover period which ended less than  30 years  before the time in question; c any earlier cover period in respect of which a claim remains to be disposed of, being  a claim made within the limitation period applicable to the claim (as defined for the purposes of section 18(1)); and for the purposes of this section the cover period in respect of which any claim is to be treated as being made shall be that in which the beginning of  that limitation period  fell. 1A In this section\u2014 a \u201cthe required amount\u201d, in relation to the provision to be made by a licensee in respect of a cover period for claims of a particular category, means an aggregate amount equal to the amount applying under paragraph (a), (c), (d) or (as the case may be) (f) of section 16(1) to the licensee, as licensee of the licensed site in question, in respect of an occurrence or event within that cover period; b the category of a claim depends on which of paragraphs (a), (c), (d) and (f) of section 16(1) applies to the occurrence or event in respect of which the claim is made. 1B Where the amount applying under section 16(1)(f) increases because one of the periods in section 16B comes to an end during a cover period, the aggregate amount that is the required amount as regards that cover period and claims in respect of such occurrences or events as fall within section 16(1)(f) increases accordingly. 2 In this Act, the

period of the licensee\u2019s responsibility shall be deemed to include any time after the expiration of that period during which it remains possible for the licensee to incur any liability by virtue of  section 7(1B)(b) , or by virtue of any relevant foreign law made for purposes corresponding to those of section 10 of this Act. 2A When the amount applicable to a licensee, as licensee of a licensed site, under paragraph (a), (c), (d) or (f) of section 16(1) changes as a result of\u2014 a the coming into force of regulations made under section 16(1)(a), (c) or (d), b an alteration relating to the site which brings it within, or takes it outside, the description prescribed by regulations made under section 16(1)(a) or (c), or c the coming into force of an order made under section 16(1A), the current cover period relating to that person as licensee of that site is to end and a new cover period is to begin. 2B The current cover period continues to run (and no new cover period begins) on the grant of a new nuclear site licence to the same licensee in respect of a site consisting of or including the site in respect of which his existing nuclear site licence is in force. 2C The current cover period continues to run (and no new cover period begins) in a case where\u2014 a the licensee of a licensed site, not having been involved earlier in that cover period in such carriage of nuclear matter as would make the amount referred to in section 16(1)(d) applicable to the licensee, becomes involved in such carriage of nuclear matter as makes the amount referred to in section 16(1)(d) applicable to the licensee, or b the licensee of a licensed site, not having been involved earlier in that cover period in such carriage of nuclear matter as would make the amount

current cover period continues to run (and no new cover period begins) if the amount applicable under section 16(1)(f) to the licensee of a licensed site is increased because one of the periods in section 16B comes to an end. 2E If\u2014 a two or more amounts referred to in section 16(1) are applicable to a licensee, as licensee of a licensed site, in any cover period, and b the licensee, as licensee of that site, has made such provision as subsection (1) requires with respect to the greater or greatest of the corresponding required amounts, the licensee is to be treated as having made such provision as subsection (1) requires with respect to the other, or each of the other, required amounts. 3 Where in the case of any licensed site the provision required by subsection (1) of this section is to be made otherwise than by insurance and, apart from this subsection, provision would also fall to be so made by the same person in respect of two or more other sites, the requirements of that subsection shall be deemed to be satisfied in respect of each of those sites if funds are available to meet such claims as are mentioned in that subsection in respect of all the sites

highest: Provided that  the appropriate authority  may in any particular case at any time direct either that this subsection shall not apply or that the funds available as aforesaid shall be of such amount higher than that provided for by the foregoing provisions of this subsection, but lower than that necessary to satisfy the requirements of the said subsection (1) in respect of all the sites severally, as may be required by the direction. 4 Where, by reason of the gravity of any occurrence  or event  which has resulted or may result in claims such as are mentioned in subsection (1) of this section against a licensee as licensee of a particular licensed site, or having regard to any previous occurrences  or events  which have resulted or may result in such claims against the licensee,  the appropriate authority  thinks it proper so to do,  the appropriate authority  shall by notice in writing to the licensee direct that a new cover period for the purposes of the said subsection (1) shall begin in respect of that site on such date not earlier than two months after the date of the service of the notice as may be specified therein. 5 If at any time while subsection (1) of this section applies in relation to any licensed site the provisions of that subsection are not complied with in respect of that site, the licensee shall be guilty of an offence and be
