consequence of any provision under subsection (1) that\u2014 a is made in the same resolution instrument, or b has been made in another resolution instrument in respect of the bank. 3 \u201c Associated provision \u201d means provision cancelling or modifying a contract under which a banking group company has a liability. 4 A power to make special bail-in provision\u2014 a may be exercised only for the purpose of, or in connection with, reducing, deferring or cancelling a liability of the bank; b may not be exercised so as to affect any excluded liability. 5 The following rules apply to the interpretation of subsection (1). 1 The reference to cancelling a liability owed by the bank includes a reference to cancelling a contract under which the bank has a liability. 2 The reference to modifying a liability owed by the bank includes a reference to modifying the terms (or the effect of the terms) of a contract under which the bank has a liability. 3 The reference to changing the form of a liability owed by the bank, includes, for example\u2014 a converting an instrument under which the bank owes a liability from one form or class to another, b replacing such an instrument with another instrument of a different form or class,  ... c creating a new security (of any form or class) in connection with the modification of such an instrument , or d  converting those liabilities

events of any specified kind have or do not have (directly or indirectly) specified consequences or are to be treated in a specified manner for specified purposes; b provision discharging persons from further performance of obligations under a contract and dealing with the consequences of persons being so discharged. 7 The form and class of the instrument (\u201cthe resulting instrument\u201d) into which an instrument is converted, or with which it is replaced, do not matter for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of rule 3 in subsection (5); for instance, the resulting instrument may (if it is a security) fall within Class 1 or any other Class in section 14. 7A Liabilities of the bank are  \u201cexcluded liabilities\u201d    if they are\u2014 a liabilities listed in subsection (8), or b

employee in relation to salary or other remuneration, except   \u2014  i variable remuneration that is not regulated by a collective bargaining agreement, and ii variable remuneration of material risk takers   within the meaning of rule 3 of Part 152 (remuneration) of the PRA rulebook (other than persons deemed by virtue of rule 3.2 not to be material risk takers and notified to the PRA in accordance with rule 3.2) ; h liabilities owed to a pension scheme, except for liabilities owed in connection with variable remuneration of the kind mentioned in paragraph (g)(i) or (ii), i liabilities owed to creditors arising from the provision to the bank of goods or services (other than financial services) that are critical to the daily functioning of the bank's operations. j liabilities owed by the bank to the scheme manager of the   FSCS in relation to levies imposed by the scheme manager under section 213(3)(b) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ; k

section 81D); b in subsection (8)(i) the reference to creditors does not include companies which are banking group companies in relation to the bank. 10 The Bank of England may, in a resolution instrument, exclude any   bail-in   liability or class of   bail-in   liabilities from the application of any special bail-in provision in relation to the bank if, and only if, the Bank of

conferred by subsection (10) may be exercised to exclude only part of   a bail-in liability , or part of each of   the bail-in liabilities   of a particular class; and where it is so exercised that part is treated as   a bail-in liability   excluded under that subsection and the remainder is treated as an   a bail-in liability   which has not been so excluded. 12 The grounds are\u2014 a that it is not reasonably possible to give effect to special bail-in provision in relation to the liability or class within a reasonable time; b that the exclusion is necessary and proportionate to achieve the continuity of critical functions and core business lines in a manner that maintains the ability of the bank to continue key operations, services and transactions; c that the exclusion is necessary and proportionate to avoid giving rise to widespread contagion, in particular as regards protected deposits held by natural persons or   micro, small and medium-sized enterprises , which would severely disrupt the functioning of financial markets, including financial market infrastructures, in a manner that could cause a serious disturbance to the economy of   the United Kingdom ; d that the making of special bail-in provision in relation to the liability would cause a reduction in value such that the losses borne by other creditors would be higher than if the liability were excluded. 13 When deciding whether to exclude liabilities under subsection (10) or (11), the Bank of England must give due consideration to\u2014 a the principle that all the liabilities of the bank ought to be treated in accordance with the priority they would enjoy on a liquidation, b the principle that any creditors who would have equal priority on a liquidation ought to bear losses on an equal footing with each other, c the level of loss absorbing capacity that would remain in the bank if the liability or liabilities of a class were wholly or partly excluded, and d the need to maintain adequate resources to deal with the implications for public funds of anything done, in future, in connection with the exercise of one or more of the stabilisation powers. 13A The Treasury may by regulations made by statutory instrument make further provision in connection with the exercise of functions under subsection (10)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(including provision about further circumstances in which functions under that subsection may or must be exercised). 13B Regulations under subsection (13A) may\u2014 a amend subsections (12) and (13) by adding any provision; b amend or revoke Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/860; c amend that Regulation by adding, omitting or varying any provision (pending the revocation of the whole Regulation under paragraph (b). 13C A statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (13A) may not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament. 14 For the purposes of subsection (12)\u2014   \u201c core business lines \u201d means business lines and associated services which represent material sources of revenue, profit or franchise value for the bank or a group which includes the bank (or in the case of an instrument made in relation to a resolution company, of the resolution company);   \u201cprotected deposit\u201d has the meaning given by section 48C, and

England and the Treasury may recover expenses incurred in connection with the making of a property transfer instrument under section 58(2)(b), ii the Bank of England and the Treasury may charge interest or fees in respect of any loans or guarantees provided to the third-country institution after the Bank has made a property transfer instrument in respect of its UK branch.   5A In subsection (5)(b)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201c relevant third-country authority \u201d means an authority in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom that has functions corresponding to the stabilisation powers of the Bank of England, the FCA or the PRA.   6  The valuation carried out under this section must follow the methodology specified in\u2014 a any Commission Regulation containing regulatory technical standards adopted by the European Commission under article 36.16 of the recovery and resolution directive, so far as they are   assimilated   law, or b technical standards made under subsection 12(a).   7 A valuation under subsection (1) must be accompanied by\u2014 a a balance sheet of the business of the UK branch as at the date of the valuation, b a report on the financial position of the UK branch, c an analysis and an estimate of the accounting value of the property and rights of the third-country institution which form part of the business of the UK branch, d a list of the outstanding liabilities of the third-country institution which form part of the business of the UK branch (including any off-balance sheet liabilities), with the creditors subdivided into classes according to the priority their claims would receive in insolvency proceedings, and e an estimate of the amount that each class of creditors and shareholders might be expected to receive if the third-country institution went into insolvency proceedings. 8 For the purposes of subsection (7)  \u201c insolvency proceedings \u201d means such insolvency proceedings (whether or not under the law of a   country or territory outside the United Kingdom ) as the person carrying out the valuation, after consultation with the Bank of England and the Treasury, considers relevant. 9 Where appropriate, the information in subsection (7)(c) may be supplemented by an analysis and estimate of the value of the business of the UK branch on a market value basis in order to inform the decision referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) or (iii) of subsection (4). 10 Where a provisional valuation is carried out under subsection (3)\u2014 a the Bank of England need only comply with subsection (7) as far as it is reasonable to do so in the circumstances, and b the requirement in subsection (8) to consult the Bank of England does not apply. 11  A provisional valuation carried out under subsection (1) must make provision in respect of additional losses by the third-country institution in accordance with\u2014 a any Commission Regulation containing regulatory technical standards adopted by the European Commission under article 36.16 of the recovery and resolution directive, so far are as they are   assimilated   law, or b technical standards made under subsection (12)(b).  12 The Bank of England may make technical standards relating to\u2014 a the methodology for assessing the value of the assets and liabilities of a branch for the purposes of a valuation under this section; b the methodology for calculating and including a buffer for additional losses in the provisional valuation. 5 For section 7 (general conditions), substitute\u2014 7 1 The Bank of England may make a property transfer instrument in respect of a UK branch only if the Treasury has approved the making of the instrument, and one of the following applies\u2014 a the PRA (or in the case of a third-country institution which is FCA-regulated, the FCA) is satisfied that Condition 1 is met, and the Bank of England is satisfied that Conditions 2, 4 and 5 are met, or b the Bank of England is satisfied that Conditions 3 and 4 are met, or c the Bank of England is satisfied that Condition 4 is met and Condition 5 is met by virtue of subsection 6(a). 2 Condition 1 is that the third-country institution is failing or likely to fail. 3 Condition 2 is that, having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, it is not reasonably likely that action will be taken by or in respect of the third-country institution that will result in Condition 1 ceasing to be met. 4 Condition 3 is that\u2014 a the third-country institution is unable or unwilling, or is likely in the near future to be unable or unwilling, to pay its debts or other liabilities owed to   UK   creditors or otherwise arising from the business of the UK branch as they fall due, and b no third-country resolution action has been taken, no normal insolvency proceedings have been initiated, and no such action or proceedings are likely in the near future to be taken or initiated, in relation to the institution. 5 Condition 4 is that making a property transfer instrument is necessary having regard to the public interest in the advancement of one or more of the special resolution objectives. 6 Condition 5 is that\u2014 a third-country resolution action has been taken, or the Bank of England has been notified that such action will be taken, in relation to the third-country institution and the Bank has refused or proposes to refuse to recognise such action for one or more of the reasons specified in section 89H(4), or b third-country resolution action has not been, and is not likely to be, taken in relation to the third-country institution. 7 For the purposes of Condition 1, a third-country institution is failing or likely to fail if it is failing, or is likely to fail, to satisfy the threshold conditions in circumstances where that failure would justify the variation or cancellation by the PRA (or in the case of an FCA-regulated third-country institution, the FCA) under section 55J of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the institution's permission under Part 4A of that Act to carry on one or more regulated activities in the United Kingdom. 8 \u201c The threshold conditions \u201d means the threshold conditions, as defined by subsection (1) of section 55B of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, for which the PRA (or in the case of an FCA-regulated third-country institution, the FCA) is treated as responsible under subsection (2) of that section. 9 For the purposes of Condition 3\u2014   \u201c UK creditor \u201d, in relation to a third-country institution, means a creditor of the institution who\u2014 in the case of an individual, is ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom; and in the case of a body corporate or unincorporated association, has its head office in the United Kingdom. 10 For the purposes of Conditions 3 and 5,  \u201c third-country resolution action \u201d has the meaning given in section 89H(7). 11 Before determining that Condition 1 is met, the PRA (or in the case of an FCA-regulated third-country institution, the FCA) must consult the Bank of England. 12 Before determining whether or not Condition 2 or 4 is met the Bank of England must, subject to subsection (13), consult\u2014 a the PRA, b the FCA, and c the Treasury. 13 In the case of an FCA-regulated third-country institution, the Bank of England need only consult the PRA before determining whether or not Condition 2 or 4 is met if the third-country institution has as a member of its immediate group a PRA-authorised person. . 6 For section 7A (effect on other group members, financial stability in EU etc) substitute\u2014 7A Where the Bank of England is considering making a property transfer instrument in respect of a UK branch of a third-country institution which is a member of a group, the Bank must have regard to\u2014 a the need to minimise the effect of making the property transfer instrument on other undertakings in the same group, b the need to minimise any adverse effects on the financial stability of the   United Kingdom , and c the potential effect of making the property transfer instrument on the financial stability of the   country or territory   in which the head office of the third-country institution is established, and any other   country or territory (other than the United Kingdom)   in which any member of the group is operating. . 7 For section 44B (property transfer instruments: special bail-in provision), substitute\u2014 44B 1 A property transfer instrument within subsection (2) may make special bail-in provision (see section 48B) with respect to the liabilities of the third-country institution or the resolution company which are being transferred by that instrument (\u201ctransferred liabilities\u201d). 2 The instruments referred to in subsection (1) are\u2014 a a property transfer instrument under section 11(2), 12(2) or 12ZA(3), b a supplemental property transfer instrument under section 42 in relation to which the original instrument is\u2014 i a property transfer instrument under section 11(2), 12(2) or 12ZA(3), or ii an onward property transfer instrument under section 43(2), or c an onward property transfer instrument under section 43(2). 3 In the case of\u2014 a a property transfer instrument under section 12(2) or 12ZA(3), b a supplemental property transfer instrument under section 42 in relation to which the original instrument is\u2014 i a property transfer instrument under section 12(2) or 12ZA(3), or ii an onward property transfer instrument under section 43(2), or c an onward property transfer instrument under section 43(2), the power under subsection (1) to make the provision described in section 48B(1)(a) (see also rule 2(a) and (b) of section 48B(5)) includes power to make the provision referred to in subsection (4). 4 The provision referred to in subsection (3) is provision replacing a transferred liability (of any form)\u2014 a of the third-country institution mentioned in subsection (1), in the case of instruments within subsection (3)(a) and (b)(i), b of the resolution company mentioned in section 43(1), in the case of instruments within subsection (3)(b)(ii) and (c), with a relevant security (of any form or class). 5 The following are relevant securities for the purpose of subsection (4)\u2014 a where the instrument within subsection (3)(a), or the original instrument, is made under section 12, a security of the bridge bank mentioned in section 12(1), b where the instrument within subsection (3)(a), or the original instrument, is made under section 12ZA, a security of the asset management vehicle mentioned in section 12ZA(1). 6 In subsection (5), references to the original instrument are\u2014 a in relation to an instrument within subsection (3)(b), the original instrument referred to in that paragraph, b in relation to an instrument within subsection (3)(c), the original instrument as defined in section 43(1). 7 Where securities of the bridge bank or asset management vehicle (\u201cB\u201d) are, as a result of subsection (3), held by a person other than the Bank of England, that does not prevent B from being regarded for the purposes of this Part (see particularly section 12(1A) and 12ZA(2)) as being wholly owned by the Bank of England, as long as the Bank of England is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, voting rights in respect of all the ordinary shares issued by B. . 8 For section 48B (special bail-in provision), substitute\u2014 48B 1 \u201cSpecial bail-in provision\u201d, for the purposes of section 44B(1), means any of the following (or any combination of the following)\u2014 a provision modifying, or changing the form of, a relevant liability; b provision that a contract under which the relevant institution has a relevant liability is to have effect as if a specified right had been exercised under it. 2 \u201cSpecial bail-in provision\u201d, for the purposes of section 44B, also includes any associated provision (see subsection (3)) that the Bank of England may think it appropriate to make in consequence of any provision under subsection (1) that\u2014 a is made in the same property transfer instrument, or b has been made in another property transfer instrument in respect of the UK branch, or (where the institution in relation to which special bail-in provision is made is a resolution company) in respect of the resolution company. 3 \u201c Associated provision \u201d means provision modifying a contract under which a company which is a banking group company in relation to the third-country institution has a liability (whether or not the institution in relation to which special bail-in provision is made is the third-country institution). 4 A power to make special bail-in provision\u2014 a may be exercised only for the purpose of, or in connection with, reducing or deferring a relevant liability of the relevant institution; b may not be exercised so as to affect any excluded liability. 5 The following rules apply to the interpretation of subsection (1). 1\u00a0The reference to modifying a relevant liability includes a reference to modifying the terms (or the effect of the terms) of a contract under which the relevant institution has a liability. 2\u00a0The reference to changing the form of a relevant liability, includes, for example\u2014 a converting an instrument under which the relevant institution owes a relevant liability from one form or class to another, b replacing such an instrument with another instrument of a different form or class, or c converting those liabilities into securities issued by a bridge bank or a UK parent undertaking. 6 For the purposes of rule 2 in subsection (5)\u2014 \u201c parent undertaking \u201d has the meaning given by Article 4.1(15)(a) of the capital requirements regulation, and \u201c UK parent undertaking \u201d means a parent undertaking that is incorporated in, or formed under the law of, any part of the United Kingdom. 7 Examples of special bail-in provision include\u2014 a provision that transactions or events of any specified kind have or do not have (directly or indirectly) specified consequences or are to be treated in a specified manner for specified purposes; b provision discharging persons from further performance of obligations under a contract and dealing with the consequences of persons being so discharged. 8 The form and class of the instrument (\u201cthe resulting instrument\u201d) into which an instrument is converted, or with which it is replaced, do not matter for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of rule 2 in subsection (5); for instance, the resulting instrument may (if it is a security) fall within Class 1 or any other Class in section 14. 9 Liabilities of the relevant institution are  \u201cexcluded liabilities\u201d if they are\u2014 a liabilities listed in subsection (10), or b liabilities which the Bank of England has excluded under subsection (12) from the application of special bail-in provision. 10 The following liabilities of the relevant institution are the excluded liabilities referred to in subsection (9)(a)\u2014 a liabilities representing protected deposits; b any liability, so far as it is secured; c liabilities that the relevant institution has by virtue of holding client assets; d liabilities with an original maturity of less than 7 days owed by the relevant institution to a credit institution or investment firm; e liabilities with a remaining maturity of less than 7 days arising from participation in designated settlement systems and owed to such systems or to operators of, or participants in, such systems;   ea liabilities with a remaining maturity of less than 7 days owed by the relevant institution to a recognised central counterparty  ... or a third country central counterparty;   f liabilities owed to an employee or former employee in relation to salary or other remuneration, except\u2014 i variable remuneration that is not regulated by a collective bargaining agreement, and ii variable remuneration of material risk takers   within the meaning of rule 3 of Part 152 (remuneration) of the PRA rulebook (other than persons deemed by virtue of rule 3.2 not to be material risk takers and notified to the PRA in accordance with rule 3.2) ; g liabilities owed to a pension scheme, except for liabilities owed in connection with variable remuneration of the kind mentioned in paragraph (f)(i) or (ii); h liabilities owed to creditors arising from the provision to the relevant institution of goods or services (other than financial services) that are critical to the daily functioning of the operations of the third-country institution or of its UK branch (or in the case of an instrument made in relation to a resolution company, of the resolution company); i liabilities owed by the relevant institution to the scheme manager of  the FSCS in relation to levies imposed by the scheme manager under section 213(3)(b) or (4) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ;   j liabilities owed by the relevant institution to another institution or a banking group company which (in either case)\u2014 i is part of the same resolution group as the relevant institution, and ii is not itself a resolution entity, where the liabilities do not rank below ordinary non-preferential debts under the hierarchy of claims in normal insolvency proceedings.   11 The following special rules apply in cases involving banking group companies (whether or not the institution in relation to which special bail-in provision is made is the third-country institution)\u2014 a a liability is not within subsection (10)(d) if the credit institution or investment firm to which the liability is owed is a banking group company in relation to the third-country institution (see section 81D); b in subsection (10)(h) the reference to creditors does not include companies which are banking group companies in relation to the third-country institution. 12 The Bank of England may, in a property transfer instrument, exclude any   bail-in   liability or class of   bail-in   liabilities from the application of any special bail-in provision in relation to a relevant institution under section 44B if, and only if, the Bank of England\u2014 a thinks the exclusion is justified on one or more of the grounds set out in subsection (14),  ... b . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 The power conferred by subsection (12) may be exercised to exclude only part of   a bail-in liability , or part of each of   the bail-in liabilities   of a particular class; and where it is so exercised that part is treated as   a bail-in liability   excluded under that subsection and the remainder is treated as   a bail-in liability   which has not been so excluded. 14 The grounds are\u2014 a that it is not reasonably possible to give effect to special bail-in provision in relation to the liability or class within a reasonable time; b that the exclusion is necessary and proportionate to achieve the continuity of critical functions and core business lines in a manner that maintains the ability of the third-country institution or its UK branch (or in the case of an instrument made in relation to a resolution company, of the resolution company) to continue key operations, services and transactions; c that the exclusion is necessary and proportionate to avoid giving rise to widespread contagion, in particular as regards protected deposits held by natural persons or   micro, small and medium-sized enterprises , which would severely disrupt the functioning of financial markets, including financial market infrastructures, in a manner that could cause a serious disturbance to the economy of   the United Kingdom ; d that the making of special bail-in provision in relation to the liability would cause a reduction in value such that the losses borne by other creditors would be higher than if the liability were excluded. 15 When deciding whether to exclude liabilities under subsection (12) or (13), the Bank of England must give due consideration to\u2014 a the principle that all the relevant liabilities of the relevant institution ought to be treated in accordance with the priority they would enjoy if the relevant institution went into insolvency proceedings, and b the principle that any creditors who would have equal priority in insolvency proceedings ought to bear losses on an equal footing with each other, and for the purposes of this subsection  \u201c insolvency proceedings \u201d means such insolvency proceedings (whether or not under the law of a   country or territory outside the United Kingdom ) as the Bank of England, after consultation with the Treasury, considers relevant. 17 For the purposes of subsection (14)\u2014   \u201c core business lines \u201d means business lines and associated services which represent material sources of revenue, profit or franchise value for the third-country institution or its UK branch (or in the case of an instrument made in relation to a resolution company, of the resolution company);   \u201c protected deposit \u201d has the meaning given by section 48C, and   \u201c micro, small and medium-sized enterprises \u201d means micro, small and medium-sized enterprises as defined with regard to the annual turnover criterion referred to in Article 2(1) of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC.     17A For the purposes of the definition of  \u201ccore business lines\u201d Article 7 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/778 (criteria relating to the determination of core business lines) applies. 17B The Treasury may by regulations made by statutory instrument specify criteria for the determination of the business lines and associated services referred to in the definition of  \u201ccore business lines\u201d. 17C The power conferred by subsection (16) includes\u2014 a power to amend or revoke Article 7 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/778; and b power to amend or repeal subsection (17A). 17D A statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (17B) is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.   18 For the purposes of this section\u2014 a \u201c relevant liability \u201d means a liability of a third-country institution or resolution company which is transferred in the property transfer instrument which makes special bail-in provision, b \u201c relevant institution \u201d means the third-country institution or resolution company whose liabilities are so transferred. . 9 For section 48X (replacement of Bank's provisional valuation), substitute\u2014 48X 1 Where the Bank of England has carried out a provisional valuation under section 6E(3) before making a property transfer instrument in relation to a UK branch, the Bank must arrange for the appointment of an independent valuer in accordance with section 62A to carry out a full valuation in accordance with this section as soon as reasonably practicable. 2 The purpose of the valuation carried out under subsection (1) is to\u2014 a ensure the full extent of any losses on the property and rights of the third-country institution which formed part of the business of the UK branch is recognised in the accounting records of the third-country institution, and b inform a decision by the Bank as to whether\u2014 i additional consideration should be paid by a bridge bank or asset management vehicle for any property, rights or liabilities transferred by the property transfer instrument, or ii the Bank should exercise the power under section 48Y(1) to increase a liability which has been reduced by the property transfer instrument. 3 A valuation carried out under subsection (1) must comply with subsections (5) and (6) of section 6E, and be accompanied by the information required in subsection (7) of that section. . 10 For section 48Y (consequences of a replacement valuation)\u2014 48Y 1 Where the independent valuation carried out under section 48X(1) produces a higher valuation of the net asset value of the business of the UK branch transferred by the property transfer instrument than the provisional valuation carried out under section 6E(3), the Bank of England may\u2014 a modify any liability of the third-country institution which has been reduced or deferred by the property transfer instrument so as to increase or reinstate that liability; or b instruct a resolution company to pay additional consideration to the third-country institution for any property, rights or liabilities transferred to the resolution company by a property transfer instrument. 2 The power in subsection (1)(a)\u2014 a may not be exercised so as to increase the value of the liability beyond the value it would have had if the property transfer instrument which reduced or deferred it had not been made, and b must be exercised by a supplemental property transfer instrument (whether or not that instrument contains any other provision authorised by this Part). 11 The Table mentioned in subsection (1) is as follows\u2014 Table of Modifications Provision
