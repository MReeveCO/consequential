Complaints to employment tribunals 63I 1 An employee who makes a section 63D application may present a complaint to an employment tribunal that\u2014 a the employer has failed to comply with section 63F(4), (5) or (6), or b the employer's decision to refuse the application, or part of it, is based on incorrect facts. This is subject to the following provisions of this section. 2 No complaint under this section may be made in respect of a section 63D application which has been disposed of by agreement or withdrawn. 3 In the case of a section 63D application that has not been disposed of by agreement or withdrawn, a complaint under this section may only be made if the employer\u2014 a notifies the employee of a decision to refuse the application (or part of it) on appeal, or b commits a breach of regulations under section 63F(4), where the breach is of a description specified by the Secretary of State in regulations. 4 No complaint under this section may be made in respect of failure to comply with provision included in regulations under section 63F(4) because of\u2014 a section 63G(1)(a) or (b), if provision is included in regulations under section 63F(4) by virtue of section 63G(1)(d), or b section 63G(1)(c). 5 An employment tribunal may not consider a complaint under this section unless the complaint is presented\u2014 a before the end of the period of three months beginning with the relevant date, or b within any further period that the tribunal considers reasonable, if the tribunal is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable for the complaint to be presented before the end of that period of three months. 6 The relevant date is\u2014 a in the case of a complaint permitted by subsection (3)(a), the date on which the employee is notified of the decision on the appeal; b in the case of a complaint permitted by subsection (3)(b), the date on which the breach was committed. Remedies 63J 1 If an employment tribunal finds a complaint under section 63I well-founded it must make a declaration to that effect and may\u2014 a make an order for reconsideration of the section 63D application; b make an award of compensation to be paid by the employer to the employee. 2 The amount of any compensation must be the amount the tribunal considers just and equitable in all the circumstances, but must not exceed the permitted maximum. 3 The permitted maximum is the number of weeks' pay specified by the Secretary of State in regulations. 4 If an employment tribunal makes an order under subsection (1)(a), section 63F and regulations under that section apply as if the application had been received on the date of the order (instead of on the date it was actually received). Supplementary 63K Regulations under this Part may make different provision for different cases. 3 After section 47E (protection from suffering detriment in employment: flexible working) insert\u2014 Study and training 47F 1 An employee has the right not to be subjected to any detriment by any act, or any deliberate failure to act, by the employee's employer done on the ground that the employee\u2014 a made (or proposed to make) a section 63D application, b exercised (or proposed to exercise) a right conferred on the employee under section 63F, c brought proceedings against the employer under section 63I, or d alleged the existence of any circumstance which would constitute a ground for bringing such proceedings. 2 This section does not apply if the detriment in question amounts to dismissal within the meaning of Part 10. 4 After section 104D (unfair dismissal: pension enrolment) insert\u2014 Study and training 104E An employee who is dismissed is to be regarded for the purposes of this Part as unfairly dismissed if the reason (or, if more than one, the principal reason) for the dismissal is that the employee\u2014 a made (or proposed to make) a section 63D application, b exercised (or proposed to exercise) a right conferred on the employee under section 63F, c brought proceedings against the employer under section 63I, or d alleged the existence of any circumstance which would constitute a ground for bringing such proceedings. 5 Schedule 1 makes amendments to employment legislation relating to the provision made by this section."}, {"act": "Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009", "year": 2009, "section": "40A", "section_title": "Sharing of information by  HMRC  and the Secretary of State", "section_text": "40A 1  HMRC  may disclose information held by them to the Secretary of State for the purpose of the Secretary of State's functions in relation to English statutory apprenticeships. 2 The Secretary of State may disclose information to  HMRC \u2014 a for the purpose of requesting  HMRC  to disclose information under subsection (1), or b for another purpose connected with the Secretary of State's functions in relation to English statutory apprenticeships. 3 In this section  \u201c English statutory apprenticeships \u201d means\u2014 a approved English apprenticeships within the meaning given in section A1;

Guidance: sections 508F and 508G 508H In making arrangements under section 508F(1) and preparing and publishing a statement under section 508G, a  local authority  must have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State under this section. Complaints about transport arrangements etc for young adults subject to learning difficulty assessment: England 508I 1 A  local authority  may revise a statement prepared under section 508G to change any matter specified under subsection (3) of that section if, as a result of a relevant young adult transport complaint, they have come to consider the change necessary for a purpose mentioned in section 508F(2) or (3). 2 A  local authority  must revise a statement prepared under section 508G to change any matter specified in subsection (3) of that section if, as a result of a relevant young adult transport complaint, the Secretary of State has directed them to do so. 3 An authority that revise a statement under subsection (1) or (2) must publish the revised statement and a description of the revision as soon as practicable. 4 The Secretary of State need not consider whether to exercise any power under sections 496 to 497A (powers to prevent unreasonable exercise of functions, etc) or subsection (2) of this section in response to a matter that is, or could have been, the subject of a relevant young adult transport complaint made to him or her unless satisfied that\u2014 a the matter has been brought to the notice of the  local authority  concerned, and b the authority have had a reasonable opportunity to investigate the matter and respond. 5 In this section  \u201c relevant young adult transport complaint \u201d means a complaint that is\u2014 a about a  local authority 's exercise of, or failure to exercise, a function under section 508F or 508G in relation to relevant young adults, and b made by a person who is, or will be, a relevant young adult when the matter complained of has effect, or by a parent of such a person, and  \u201c relevant young adult \u201d has the meaning given in section 508F. 6 For the purposes of sections 508G(7) and 508H, the revision of a statement under this section is to be treated as the preparation of a statement under section 508G. 7 Where a  local authority  have published in a single document a statement prepared under section 509AA and a statement prepared under 508G, the requirement to publish a revised statement under subsection (3) is to be treated as a requirement to publish a version of the document that includes the revised statement. 3 In section 509AD(2) ( Local authorities  in England: duty

b circumstances in which any early childhood services should be made available through children's centres as mentioned in subsection (5)(b). 7 A children's centre provided by virtue of arrangements made by an English local authority under section 3(2) is to be known as a Sure Start Children's Centre.
