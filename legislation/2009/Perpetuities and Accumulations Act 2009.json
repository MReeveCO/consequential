condition is broken, or b any equivalent right exercisable in the case of property other than land if the condition is broken. 5 If an instrument which is a will limits personal property so as to create successive interests under the doctrine of executory bequests, the rule applies to each of the interests. 6 If an instrument creates a power of appointment the rule applies to the power. 7 For
