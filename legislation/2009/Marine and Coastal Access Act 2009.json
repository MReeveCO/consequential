Amendment and revocation 5 1 If at any time the appropriate national authority is satisfied that an emergency fisheries byelaw would better serve to prevent or limit the harm referred to in paragraph 1(2)(a) above if it were amended, the authority must amend it accordingly. 2 If at any time the appropriate national authority is satisfied that an emergency fisheries byelaw is no longer needed in order to prevent or limit the harm referred to in paragraph 1(2)(a) above, the authority must revoke it. 3 The Agency must publish notice of an amendment or revocation under this paragraph as specified in paragraph 4(a) to (c) above. Expiry and extension 6 1 Subject to paragraph 7 below, an emergency fisheries byelaw expires (unless earlier revoked)\u2014 a in accordance with provision made by the byelaw, or b if the byelaw does not contain provision for its expiry, at the end of the period of twelve months beginning with the day on which it comes into force. 2 A byelaw may not under sub-paragraph (1)(a) above remain in force for longer than the period of twelve months beginning with the day on which it comes into force. 7 1 The Agency may, at any time before an emergency fisheries byelaw expires, apply to the appropriate national authority for it to be extended. 2 On such an application, the appropriate national authority may extend the byelaw at any time before its expiry, provided the authority is satisfied that\u2014 a the byelaw is still needed to prevent or limit the harm referred to in paragraph 1(2)(a) above, and b the need for the extension could not reasonably have been avoided by the Agency. 3 A byelaw may be extended under sub-paragraph (2) above for such period not exceeding six months as the appropriate national authority may specify. 4 A byelaw may not be extended under sub-paragraph (2) above on more than one occasion. Availability 8 1 Every emergency fisheries byelaw shall be printed and deposited at one or more of the offices of the Agency, including (if there is one) at an office in the area to which the byelaw applies; and copies of the byelaw shall be available at those offices, at all reasonable times, for inspection by the public free of charge. 2 Every person shall be entitled, on application to the Agency and on payment of such reasonable sum as the Agency may determine, to be furnished with a copy of any emergency fisheries byelaw so deposited by the Agency.
