Appeals 195O 1 If on an application for an order under section 195M the court decides not to make one, a person mentioned in subsection (3) of that section may appeal to the county court against the decision. 2 If an application is made under section 195N in relation to an order the following persons may appeal to the county court in respect of the magistrates' court's decision on the application\u2014 a a person mentioned in section 195M(3), or b any person affected by the order. Detention of property pending section 195O appeal 195P 1 This section applies where\u2014 a an application for an order under section 195M is made within the period mentioned in section 195J, and b the application is refused. 2 This section also applies where\u2014 a an order is made under section 195M extending the period for which property may be detained under section 195J, and b the order is discharged or varied so that detention of the property is no longer authorised by virtue of the order. 3 The property may be detained until there is no further possibility of an appeal against the decision to refuse the application or discharge or vary the order (as the case may be). Hearsay evidence in detention order proceedings 195Q 1 Evidence must not be excluded in detention order proceedings on the ground that it is hearsay (of whatever degree). 2 Articles 4 and 5 of the Civil Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 apply in relation to detention order proceedings as those articles apply in relation to civil proceedings. 3 Detention order proceedings are proceedings\u2014 a for an order under section 195M; b for the discharge or variation of such an order; c on an appeal under section 195O. 4 Hearsay is a statement which is made otherwise than by a person while giving oral evidence in the proceedings and which is tendered as evidence of the matters stated. 5 Nothing in this section affects the admissibility of evidence which is admissible apart from this section. Release of property 195R 1 This section applies in relation to property which\u2014 a has been seized by an appropriate officer under section 195C, and b is detained under or by virtue of any of sections 195J to 195M and 195P. 2 The property must be released if at any time an appropriate officer decides that the detention condition is no longer met. 3 The detention condition is met for so long as\u2014 a any of the conditions in section 195B is met, and b there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion mentioned in section 195C(1). 4 Nothing in this section requires property to be released if there is a power to detain it otherwise than under or by virtue of sections 195J to 195M and 195P. 5 Nothing in this section affects the operation of any power or duty to release property that arises apart from this section.

"65 1 After section 297 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 insert\u2014 Forfeiture without court order Forfeiture notice 297A 1 Subsection (2) applies while any cash is detained in pursuance of an order under section 295(2) made by a magistrates' court in England and Wales or Northern Ireland. 2 A senior officer may give a notice for the purpose of forfeiting the cash or any part of it if satisfied that the cash or part\u2014 a is recoverable property, or b is intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct. 3 The Secretary of State must make regulations about how a notice is to be given. 4 The regulations may provide\u2014 a for a notice to be given to such person or persons, and in such manner, as may be prescribed; b for a notice to be given by publication in such manner as may be prescribed; c for circumstances in which, and the time at which, a notice is to be treated as having been given. 5 The regulations must ensure that where a notice is given it is, if possible, given to every person to whom notice of an order under section 295(2) in respect of the cash has been given. 6 A senior officer means\u2014 a an officer of Revenue and Customs of a rank designated by the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs as equivalent to that of a senior police officer, b a senior police officer, or c an accredited financial investigator. 7 A senior police officer means a police officer of at least the rank of inspector. 8 A notice under this section is referred to in this Chapter as a forfeiture notice. Content 297B 1 A forfeiture notice must\u2014 a state the amount of cash in respect of which it is given, b state when and where the cash was seized, c confirm that the senior officer is satisfied as mentioned in section 297A(2), d specify a period for objecting to the proposed forfeiture and an address to which any objections must be sent, and e explain that the cash will be forfeited unless an objection is received at that address within the period for objecting. 2 The period for objecting must be at least 30 days starting with the day after the notice is given. Effect 297C 1 This section applies if a forfeiture notice is given in respect of any cash. 2 The cash is to be detained until\u2014 a the cash is forfeited under this section, b the notice lapses under this section, or c the cash is released under a power conferred by this Chapter. 3 If no objection is made within the period for objecting, and the notice has not lapsed, the cash is forfeited (subject to section 297E). 4 If an objection is made within the period for objecting, the notice lapses. 5 If an application is made for the forfeiture of the whole or any part of the cash under section 298, the notice lapses. 6 If the cash or any part of it is released under a power conferred by this Chapter, the notice lapses or (as the case may be) lapses in relation to that part. 7 An objection may be made by anyone, whether a recipient of the notice or not. 8 An objection means a written objection sent to the address specified in the notice; and an objection is made when it is received at the address. 9 An objection does not prevent forfeiture of the cash under section 298. 10 Nothing in this section affects the validity of an order under section 295(2). Detention following lapse of notice 297D 1 This section applies if\u2014 a a forfeiture notice is given in respect of any cash, b the notice lapses under section 297C(4), and c the period for which detention of the cash was authorised under section 295(2) has expired. 2 The cash may be detained for a further period of up to 48 hours (calculated in accordance with section 295(1B)). 3 But if within that period the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, a constable or an accredited financial investigator decides that neither of the applications mentioned in subsection (4) ought to be made, the cash must be released. 4 The applications are\u2014 a an application for a further order under section 295(2); b an application for forfeiture of the cash under section 298. 5   \u201c                                If within that period an application is made for a further order under section 295(2) the cash may be detained until the application is determined or otherwise disposed of.                              \u201d Application to set aside forfeiture 297E 1 This section applies if any cash is forfeited in pursuance of a forfeiture notice. 2 A person aggrieved by the forfeiture may apply to a magistrates' court in England and Wales or Northern Ireland for an order setting aside the forfeiture of the cash or any part of it. 3 The application must be made before the end of the period of 30 days starting with the day on which the period for objecting ended. 4 But the court may give permission for an application to be made after the 30-day period has ended if it thinks that there are exceptional circumstances to explain why the applicant\u2014 a failed to object to the forfeiture within the period for objecting, and b failed to make an application within the 30-day period. 5 On an application under this section the court must consider whether the cash to which the application relates could be forfeited under section 298 (ignoring the forfeiture mentioned in subsection (1) above). 6 If the court is satisfied that the cash to which the application relates or any part of it could not be forfeited under that section it must set aside the forfeiture of that cash or part. 7 Where the court sets aside the forfeiture of any cash\u2014 a it must order the release of that cash, and b that cash is to be treated as never having been forfeited. Release of cash subject to forfeiture notice 297F 1 This section applies while any cash is detained under section 297C or 297D. 2 A magistrates' court may direct the release of the whole or any part of the cash if the following condition is met. 3 The condition is that the court is not satisfied, on an application by the person from whom the cash was seized, that the cash to be released\u2014 a is recoverable property, or b is intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct. 4 An officer of Revenue and Customs, constable or accredited financial investigator may release the cash or any part of it if satisfied that the detention of the cash to be released is no longer justified. Application of forfeited cash 297G 1 Cash forfeited in pursuance of a forfeiture notice, and any accrued interest on it, is to be paid into the Consolidated Fund. 2 But it is not to be paid in\u2014 a before the end of the period within which an application under section 297E may be made (ignoring the possibility of an application by virtue of section 297E(4)), or b if an application is made within

Aerodrome security planning Aerodrome security plans 24AE 1 There must be an aerodrome security plan in force in relation to an aerodrome at all times after the period of 9 months beginning with the day by which the security executive group for the aerodrome is required to be established. 2 An aerodrome security plan is a plan which specifies\u2014 a the security measures, if any, that each relevant person is to take in relation to the aerodrome during the period for which the plan is in force, and b the arrangements for monitoring the implementation of those measures (\u201cmonitoring arrangements\u201d). 3 An aerodrome security plan may specify steps to be taken by a relevant person for the purposes of the monitoring arrangements (\u201cmonitoring steps\u201d). 4 The relevant persons are\u2014 a the manager of the aerodrome, b the chief officer of police for the relevant police area, c any operator of an aircraft that takes off from, or lands at, the aerodrome, d any person who is permitted to have access to the aerodrome for the purposes of a business carried on by the person, e any person who occupies any land forming part of the aerodrome, f the Serious Organised Crime Agency, g the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, and h the Secretary of State. 5 If the plan specifies security measures to be taken by a person within subsection (4)(a) or (c) to (h) (\u201cB\u201d), the plan may also specify\u2014 a that any other relevant person is to make payments in respect of the costs reasonably incurred by B in connection with the security measures, and b the amount of those payments or the manner in which their amount is to be assessed. 6 If the plan specifies security measures to be taken by a person within subsection (4)(c) to (h), the plan may also specify that the manager of the aerodrome is to provide accommodation or facilities in connection with those measures. 7 A relevant person must comply with any provision of an aerodrome security plan which provides that the person is to\u2014 a take a security measure, b take a monitoring step, or c make any payments or provide any accommodation or facilities. 8 In subsection (1),  \u201c the day by which the security executive group for the aerodrome is required to be established \u201d means the day which is the relevant day in relation to the aerodrome for the purposes of section 24AL. Aerodrome security plans: duration etc. 24AF 1 An aerodrome security plan must specify the period for which it is to be in force. 2 In the case of the first plan for the aerodrome, the period specified must\u2014 a begin on the day after the end of the period mentioned in section 24AE(1), and b end on either the 31 March next following that day or on any subsequent 31 March specified in the plan. 3 In the case of any subsequent plan, the period specified must\u2014 a begin on 1 April, and b end on either the 31 March next following that day or on any subsequent 31 March specified in the plan. 4 An aerodrome security plan ceases to be in force if the aerodrome to which it relates ceases to be one to which this Part applies. 5 If there is a dispute about security planning for an aerodrome which relates to an aerodrome security plan which is not in force, the Secretary of State may direct that the plan is to come into force at the beginning of a day other than that specified in subsection (2)(a) or (3)(a). Security executive groups 24AG 1 The manager of an aerodrome must establish a group (\u201cthe security executive group\u201d) for the aerodrome. 2 The group is to consist of\u2014 a a representative of the manager of the aerodrome, b the chief officer of police for the relevant police area or a representative of the chief officer, c a representative of the police authority for the relevant police area, d if the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs so request, a representative of the Commissioners, e if the Serious Organised Crime Agency so request, a representative of the Agency, f the individual nominated under subsection (3), and g any individuals nominated under subsections (4) to (6). 3 The manager of the aerodrome must nominate as a member of the group an individual who appears to the manager to represent the interests of the operators of aircraft that take off from, or land at, the aerodrome. 4 The Secretary of State may at any time nominate as a member of the group an official of the Secretary of State who exercises functions relating to immigration. 5 The manager of the aerodrome or the Secretary of State may at any time nominate as a member of the group an individual who is, or who appears to the manager or (as the case may be) the Secretary of State to represent the interests of, a particular relevant person within section 24AE(4)(c) to (e). 6 The manager of the aerodrome or the Secretary of State may at any time nominate as a member of the group an individual who appears to the manager or (as the case may be) the Secretary of State to represent the interests of any description of relevant persons within section 24AE(4)(c) to (e). 7 More than one individual may be nominated under subsection (5) or (6) (but not in relation to the same relevant person or description of relevant persons). 8 The group must permit any individuals nominated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this subsection to attend meetings of the group as observers. Functions of security executive groups 24AH 1 The security executive group for an aerodrome must\u2014 a decide the contents of each aerodrome security plan for the aerodrome, and b keep the contents of each plan under review and decide whether (and, if so, how) they should be varied. 2 No provision may be included in an aerodrome security plan unless all the members of the group unanimously agree that it should be included. 3 An aerodrome security plan may not be varied unless all the members of the group unanimously agree to the variation. 4 But the agreement of a member is not required for the purposes of subsection (2) or (3) if the member unreasonably fails to inform the other members of the group whether the member agrees or disagrees to the inclusion of the provision or (as the case may be) to the variation. 5 If the Secretary of State at any time requests a copy of an aerodrome security plan, the manager of the aerodrome must give a copy of the plan to the Secretary of State. Objections to proposals by security executive groups 24AI 1 The security executive group for an aerodrome must notify a person to whom this section applies if\u2014 a the group proposes to include a provision in an aerodrome security plan or to vary a provision in a plan, and b the provision (or the provision as varied) would by virtue of section 24AE require the person to\u2014 i take a security measure, ii take a monitoring step, or iii make any payments. 2 This section applies to\u2014 a any relevant person within section 24AE(4)(c) to (e), other than such a person who is represented on the security executive group by virtue of section 24AG(5), b the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, unless the Commissioners are represented on the group, c the Serious Organised Crime Agency, unless the Agency is represented on the group, d the Secretary of State, unless the Secretary of State has made a nomination under section 24AG(4). 3 A person notified under subsection (1) may object to the proposal by informing the group that the person objects. 4 The person must give the group the reasons for the objection. 5 The objection must be made before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the person was notified of the proposal (\u201cthe 30 day period\u201d). 6 The group must consider an objection made by a person in accordance with this section. 7 If the members of the group and the person are unable to reach agreement on whether or not the proposal should be withdrawn or varied in the light of the objection, the member of the group who represents the manager of the aerodrome must refer the matter under section 24AN(1) (disputes about security plans). 8 A provision mentioned in subsection (1) may not be included in an aerodrome security plan or (as the case may be) may not be varied before the end of the 30 day period. 9 If an objection is made in accordance with this section before the end of the 30 day period the provision may not be included in the plan or (as the case may be) may not be varied unless\u2014 a the members of the group and the person who objected agree that it may be included or varied, or b it is included or varied by virtue of section 24AQ (powers in relation to disputes about security plans). Discharge of functions by security executive groups 24AJ 1 In exercising its functions, the security executive group for an aerodrome must have regard to\u2014 a any directions given under section 12, 13, 13A or 14, b the risk report for the aerodrome, c any national threat assessment, and d any guidance given by the Secretary of State which is relevant to the group's functions. 2 The group must\u2014 a consider each recommendation in the risk report, and b ensure that a record of its decision whether to accept or reject the recommendation, together with the reasons for the decision, is appended to an aerodrome security plan. 3 A member of the security executive group may not disclose any information received by the member in the exercise of the member's functions under this Part except\u2014 a for the purpose of any of those functions, or b for any other purpose connected with the making of aerodrome security plans or their implementation. 4 In this section,  \u201c national threat assessment \u201d means any assessment issued by the Secretary of State of a threat to the aviation industry. Aerodrome security groups: general Aerodrome groups: supplemental 24AK 1 An individual may be a member of both the risk advisory group and the security executive group for an aerodrome. 2 The manager of the aerodrome may at any time\u2014 a revoke a nomination under section 24AB(2)(a) or 24AG(3), and b make another nomination under that provision. 3 A person who makes a nomination under section 24AB(2)(b) or (3) to (6) or (9) or section 24AG(4) to (6) or (8) may at any time revoke the nomination (whether or not the person makes another nomination under the provision in question). 4 Except as provided by this Part, risk advisory groups and security executive groups may decide their own procedures (and, in particular, may allow individuals who are not members of the groups to attend meetings and take part in discussions). 5 The manager of an aerodrome must ensure that the risk advisory group and the security executive group for the aerodrome have such accommodation and facilities as are necessary to enable them to discharge their functions. Period for establishment of aerodrome groups 24AL 1 The risk advisory group and the security executive group for an aerodrome must each be established before the relevant day. 2 In the case of an aerodrome to which this Part applies on the commencement date, the relevant day is \u2014 a in relation to the risk advisory group, the end of the period of 1 month beginning with the commencement date, and b in relation to the security executive group, the end of the period of 3 months beginning with the commencement date. 3 In subsection (2),  \u201c commencement date \u201d means the date on which section 79 of the Policing and Crime Act 2009 comes into force. 4 In the case of any other aerodrome to which this Part applies, the relevant day is\u2014 a in relation to the risk advisory group, the end of the period of 1 month beginning with the date on which the aerodrome becomes one to which this Part applies, and b in relation to the security executive group, the end of the period of 3 months beginning with that date.
