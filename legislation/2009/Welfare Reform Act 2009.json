includes the licence's counterpart (within the meaning of section 108(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1988). Appeals against disqualification orders 39CB 1 A person against whom a disqualification order is made may appeal to the court against the order within a prescribed period (which must begin with the first day on which that person had actual notice of the order). 2 Where an appeal is brought under subsection (1), the running of the period for which the order has effect shall be suspended until the time at which the appeal is determined, withdrawn or discontinued. 3 If\u2014 a the person against whom a disqualification order is made does not bring an appeal within the period specified in subsection (1), and b prescribed conditions are satisfied, the court may grant leave for an appeal to be brought after the end of that period. 4 On granting leave under subsection (3) the court may suspend the running of the period for which the order has effect until such time and on such conditions (if any) as it thinks just. 5 On an appeal under this section the court\u2014 a shall reconsider the exercise by the  Secretary of State  of  the  powers under section 39B; and b may by order affirm, vary or revoke the disqualification order. 6 On an appeal under this section the court shall not question\u2014 a the liability order by reference to which the  Secretary of State  acted as mentioned in section 39B(1)(a); b any liability order made against the same person after the disqualification order was made; or c the maintenance calculation by reference to which any liability order within paragraph (a) or (b) was made. 7 The power under subsection (5) to vary a disqualification order includes power to extend the period for which it has effect; but that power may not be exercised so as to provide for it to have effect for a period exceeding 2 years in total. 8 If, on appeal under this section, the court affirms or varies a disqualification order, the court shall substitute for the amount specified under section 39B(5) the aggregate of\u2014 a the amount sought to be recovered as mentioned in section 39B(1)(a), or so much of it as remains unpaid; b the amount which the person against whom the order was made is required to pay by the order under section 39DA(1), so far as remaining unpaid; c the amount which that person is required to pay by the order under section 39DA(2); and d if a liability order has been made against that person since the disqualification order was made, the amount in respect of which the liability order was made, so far as remaining unpaid. 9 On the affirmation or variation of the disqualification order by the court, any existing suspension of the running of the period for which the order is to have effect shall cease. 10 But the court may suspend the running of that period until such time and on such conditions (if any) as it thinks fit if\u2014 a the person against whom the disqualification order was made agrees to pay the amount specified in the order; or b the court is of the opinion that the suspension in question is justified by exceptional circumstances. 11 If, on an appeal under this section, the court revokes a disqualification order, the court shall also revoke the order made under section 39DA(1). 12 But subsection (11) does not apply if the court is of the opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances, it is reasonable to require the person against whom the disqualification order was made to pay the costs mentioned in section 39DA(1). 13 In this section  \u201c the court \u201d means\u2014 a in relation to England and Wales, a magistrates' court; b in relation to Scotland, the sheriff. 5 After section 39D insert\u2014 Recovery of  Secretary of State\u2019s  costs 39DA 1 On making a disqualification order against any person the  Secretary of State  shall also make an order requiring that person to pay an amount in respect of the costs incurred by the  Secretary of State  in exercising  ... functions under section 39B. 2 If on an appeal under section 39CB the court affirms or varies a disqualification order made against any person, the court shall also make an order requiring that person to pay an amount in respect of the costs incurred by the  Secretary of State  in connection with the appeal (\u201cthe  Secretary of State\u2019s  appeal costs\u201d). 3 If\u2014 a on an appeal under that section the court revokes a disqualification order made against any person, and b the court is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, it is reasonable to require that person to pay an amount in respect of the  Secretary of State\u2019s  appeal costs, the court shall also make an order requiring that person to pay an amount in respect of those costs. 4 Any amount payable by virtue of an order made under this section shall be\u2014 a specified in the order; and b determined in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State. 5 The provisions of this Act with respect to\u2014 a the collection of child support maintenance, and b the enforcement of an obligation to pay child support maintenance, apply equally (with any necessary modifications) to amounts which a person is required to pay under this section. 6 Schedule 5 contains consequential amendments and other amendments related to the provision made by this section."}, {"act": "Welfare Reform Act 2009", "year": 2009, "section": "52", "section_title": "Report on operation of driving licence amendments", "section_text": "52 1 The Secretary of State must prepare a report on the operation during the review period of the amendments of the 1991 Act made by section 51 and Schedule 5 so far as those amendments relate to the disqualification of any person for holding or obtaining a driving licence. 2 \u201cThe review period\u201d is the period of 24 months beginning with the day on which section 51 and Schedule 5 come into force in relation to the disqualification of any person for holding or obtaining a driving licence. 3 The Secretary of State must\u2014 a prepare the report, and b lay it before Parliament, within 6 months from the end of the review period. 4 The continued effect of the driving licence amendments depends on whether the Secretary of State makes an order under this subsection within the relevant period providing for those provisions to continue to have effect. 5 \u201c The relevant period \u201d means the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the report is laid before Parliament;
