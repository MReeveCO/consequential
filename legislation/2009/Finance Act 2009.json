contained in the original lease is  \u201crelevant\u201d if the right to terminate the lease that it confers is capable of being exercised in such a way that the term of the original lease is 10 years

assumption that any relevant break clause is exercised in such a way that the term of the lease is as short as possible. 4 If a relevant break clause is not in fact exercised in such a way that the term of the original lease is as short as possible, the parties to the lease are treated for the purposes of section 105A as if they were parties to another lease (a  \u201cnotional lease\u201d) the term of which\u2014 a begins immediately after the time at which the term of the original lease would have ended, if that break clause had been so exercised, and b ends at the time mentioned in subsection (5). 5 The term of a notional lease ends\u2014 a at the time the term of the original lease would end, on the assumption that any relevant break clause that is exercisable only after the beginning of the term of the notional lease is exercised in such a way that the term of the original lease is as short as possible, or b if earlier, the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the term of the original lease. 6 For the purposes of section 105A the net amount payable by P in relation to a notional lease by way of lease premium is, in the case of a notional lease the term of which ends under paragraph (a) of subsection (5)\u2014 a the net amount that would be payable by P in relation to the original lease by way of lease premium on the assumption mentioned in that paragraph, less b any part of that amount that has already been attributed to a period in respect of a lease premium under section 105(4B)(b). 7 For the purposes of section 105A the net amount payable by P in relation

would be payable by P in relation to the original lease by way of lease premium, on the assumption that no break clause is exercised, less b any part of that amount that has already been attributed to

entered into before that date the term of which is extended on or after that date. 5 In relation to a lease of the kind mentioned in subsection (4)(b) the amendments made by this section have
