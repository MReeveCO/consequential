Any owner of the lands who fails to serve such notice as aforesaid on the owner of the tithe rentcharge, shall not be entitled to recover from the occupier any sum which he has paid on account of tithe rentcharge as aforesaid, unless and until he has, after notice to the occupier of his application for the same, obtained from the county court a certificate that there was good and sufficient cause for the failure to give such notice, and that the occupier has not been prejudiced thereby. 7 Rules under this Act may regulate the procedure practice and costs under this Act in county courts, and may direct what service shall be good service for the purposes of this Act on the owner or occupier of any lands or the owner of any tithe rentcharge, and may provide that, if the owner of any lands is not known, any proceeding under this Act may be taken against the owner of the lands without naming the person who is the owner. 8 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   the fees, charges, and expenses in or incidental to any distress under this Act shall be the same as are for the time being payable under the  Law of Distress Amendment Act, 1888. 9 Nothing in this Act shall impose or constitute any personal liability upon any occupier or owner of lands for the payment of any tithe rentcharge, or any other sum recoverable or payable under this Act, and the court shall not, by virtue of this Act, or of the  County Courts Act, 1888, have any power to imprison any such occupier or owner by reason only of the nonpayment of such tithe rentcharge or other sum, and shall in any other case have no other or greater powers of fine or imprisonment than are conferred by the County Courts Act, 1888."}, {"act": "Tithe Act 1891 (repealed 5.11.1993)", "year": 1891, "section": "3", "section_title": " Rules.", "section_text": "3 1 The Lord Chancellor may, after consultation with the Rule Committee of County Court Judges, make rules for carrying this Act into effect, and for regulating, providing, and prescribing any matter authorised by this Act to be regulated, provided, or prescribed by rules under this Act.
