ground, buildings, structures or works which, by virtue of the foregoing provisions of this subsection, are not included in the sublease) extends to  one half hectare ; d any right pertaining to the tenancy of the croft to cut or take peat. 11 A sublease of any croft granted under subsection (7) of this section by the Commission shall have effect in all respects as if it had been granted by the crofter in accordance with proposals submitted to the Commission under subsection (4) of this section and approved by them. 12 The rent payable under a sublease granted under subsection (7) of this section by the Commission shall, in the case of a sublease of a whole croft, or of a whole croft other than any subjects which, by virtue of subsection (10) of this section, are not included in the sublease, be a sum equal to one and one quarter times the rent payable to the landlord by the crofter in respect of the croft, and, in any other case, be such proportion of the said sum as the Commission may determine: Provided that the Land Court may, on an application in that behalf made by the crofter within six months from the date on which notice intimating the grant of the sublease was given to him under subsection (9) of this section by the Commission, vary the rent fixed by or under this subsection and substitute therefor such other rent, whether higher or lower than the rent so fixed, as may appear to the Land Court to be just in all the circumstances, and the rent determined by the Land Court in pursuance of this proviso shall be payable under the sublease, in place of the rent fixed as aforesaid, as from the date of entry under the sublease. 13 The duration of any sublease granted under subsection (7) of this section by the Commission shall, subject to the provisions of the next following subsection and of subsection (3) of the next following section, be such number of years, not exceeding five, as the Commission may determine, and any such sublease shall be granted subject to the following terms and conditions, that is to say\u2014 a the subtenant shall make adequate use of the land comprised in the sublease; b the subtenant shall maintain any permanent improvements existing on such land at the date of the commencement of the sublease in as good a state of repair as they were in at the said date and, if he fails to do so, shall on the termination of the sublease pay to the crofter the cost, as at the date of such termination, of making good any deterioration of, or damage to, such improvements due to his failure, which cost shall, failing agreement between the subtenant and the crofter, be determined by the Land Court; c the subtenant shall not make any permanent improvements on the land comprised in the sublease, other than an improvement falling under head 3, 4, 5 or 6 of the Fifth Schedule to the Act of 1955, and the crofter shall not be held responsible for the maintenance of any permanent improvements erected by the subtenant without the consent of the crofter; and to such other terms and conditions as may be specified in the sublease. 14 If the Commission are satisfied in relation to any sublease granted by them under subsection (7) of this section\u2014 a that the subtenant has broken one or more of the terms or conditions of the sublease, or b where representations in that behalf are made by the crofter or by the subtenant, that the circumstances of either of them have so materially altered that it is reasonable that the sublease should be terminated, the Commission may serve on the crofter and on the subtenant a notice in writing terminating the sublease on such date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not later than one year from the date of the service of the notice. 15 Where any person occupying a croft\u2014 a has, by virtue of any of the provisions of this section, ceased to be entitled to occupy such croft; or b is a subtenant to whom the croft has been sublet by the crofter after the date on which a further notice was served on the crofter by the Commission under subsection (4) of this section and otherwise than in accordance with proposals submitted to the Commission under that subsection and approved by them; The Commission may serve on such person a notice in writing requiring him to give up his occupation of the croft on or before such date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not less than one month from the date of the service of the notice; and if he fails to give up his occupation of the croft on or before the date so specified, subsection (3) of section seventeen of the Act of 1955 (which provides for the ejection of a crofter from his croft in certain circumstances) shall, subject to any necessary modifications, apply as it applies where a crofter fails to give up the occupation of a croft as mentioned in that subsection. 16 In this section \u201c adequate use \u201d in relation to a croft means such use of the croft for agriculture as, having regard to its nature and location, a tenant reasonably skilled in husbandry might be expected to make of it."}, {"act": "Crofters (Scotland) Act 1961 (repealed 5.1.1994)",
