This subsection applies a to any relief given with a view to promoting industrial, commercial, scientific, educational or other development in a territory outside the United Kingdom, being a relief with respect to which provision is made in the arrangements in question for double taxation relief, b to any relief provided under and in accordance with the arrangements, where the latter expressly contemplate that the relief is to fall within this subsection. 4 Except in the case of a claim for an allowance by way of credit in accordance with Chapter II below, a claim for relief under subsection (1)(a) above shall be made to the Board. 5 Where, under any arrangements which have effect by virtue of this section, relief may be given, either in the United Kingdom or in the territory with the government of which the arrangements are made, in respect of any income, and it appears that the assessment to income tax or corporation tax made in respect of the income is not made in respect of the full amount thereof, or is incorrect having regard to the credit, if any, which falls to be given under the arrangements, any such assessments may be made as are necessary to ensure that the total amount of the income is assessed, and the proper credit, if any, is given in respect thereof, and, where the income is entrusted to any person in the United Kingdom for payment, any such assessment may be made on the recipient of the income under Case VI of Schedule D. 6 Any arrangements to which effect is given under this section may include provision for relief from tax for periods before the passing of this Act, or before the making of the arrangements, and provisions as to income which is not itself subject to double taxation, and the preceding provisions of this section shall have effect accordingly. 7 Any Order in Council made under this section may be revoked by a subsequent Order in Council, and any such revoking Order may contain such transitional provisions as appear to Her Majesty to be necessary or expedient. 8 Before any Order proposed to be made under this section is submitted to Her Majesty in Council, a draft thereof shall be laid before the House of Commons, and the Order shall not be so submitted unless an Address is presented to Her Majesty by that House praying that the Order be made. 9 Notwithstanding section 501(2) below, any

have effect in relation to the profits tax and profits chargeable thereto (with the substitution of accounting periods for chargeable accounting periods), and not as they have effect in relation to income tax. 10 In so far as any arrangements made before 30th March 1971 provide for the exemption of any income from surtax they shall have effect, unless otherwise modified by subsequent arrangements, as if they provided for that income to bear income tax at the basic rate and to be disregarded for the purpose of computing total income, except in so far as the computation affects the matters mentioned in section 34(3) of the Finance Act  1971, but not to be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether that income or any other income is chargeable as investment income."},
