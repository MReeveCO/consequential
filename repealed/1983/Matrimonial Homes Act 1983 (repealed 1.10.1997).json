remain in occupation, and the other spouse is not so entitled, then, subject to the provisions of this Act, the spouse not so entitled shall have the following rights (in this Act referred to as \u201c rights of occupation \u201d)\u2014 a if in occupation, a right not to be evicted or excluded from the dwelling house or any part thereof by the other spouse except with the leave of the court given by an order under this section; b if not in occupation, a right with the leave of the court so given to enter into and occupy the dwelling house. 2 So long as one spouse has rights of occupation, either of the spouses may apply to the court for an order\u2014 a declaring, enforcing, restricting or terminating those rights, or b prohibiting, suspending or restricting the exercise by either spouse of the right to occupy the dwelling house, or c requiring either spouse to permit the exercise by the other of that right. 3 On an application for an order under this section, the court may make such order as it thinks just and reasonable having regard to the conduct of the spouses in relation to each other and otherwise, to their respective needs and financial resources, to the needs of any children and to all the circumstances of the case, and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision\u2014 a may except part of the dwelling house from a spouse\u2019s rights of occupation (and in particular a part used wholly or mainly for or in connection with the trade, business or profession of the other spouse), b may order a spouse occupying the dwelling house or any part thereof by virtue of this section to make periodical payments to the other in respect of the occupation, c may impose on either spouse obligations as to the repair and maintenance of the dwelling house or the discharge of any liabilities in respect of the dwelling house. 4 Orders under this section may, in so far as they have a continuing effect, be limited so as to have effect for a period specified in the order or until further order. 5 Where a spouse is entitled under this section to occupy a dwelling house or any part thereof, any payment or tender made or other thing done by that spouse in or towards satisfaction of any liability of the other spouse in respect of rent, rates, mortgage payments or other outgoings affecting the dwelling house shall, whether or not it is made or done in pursuance of an order under this section, be as good as if made or done by the other spouse. 6 A spouse\u2019s occupation by virtue of this section shall, for the purposes of the  Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976, and of the  Rent Act 1977 (other than Part V and sections 103 to 106), be treated as possession by the other spouse and  for the purposes of Part IV of the Housing Act 1985  and Part I of the  Housing Act 1988  (secure tenancies) and Chapter I of Part V of the Housing Act 1996 (introductory tenancies) be treated as occupation by the other spouse. 7 Where a spouse is entitled under this section to occupy a dwelling house or any part thereof and makes any payment in or towards satisfaction of any liability of the other spouse in respect of mortgage payments affecting the dwelling house, the person to whom the payment is made may treat it as having been made by that other spouse, but the fact that that person has treated any such payment as having been so made shall not affect any claim of the first-mentioned spouse against the other to an interest in the dwelling house by virtue of the payment. 8 Where a spouse is entitled under this section to occupy a dwelling house or part thereof by reason of an interest of the other spouse under a trust, all the provisions of subsections (5) to (7) above shall apply in relation to the trustees as they apply in relation to the other spouse. 9 The jurisdiction conferred on the court by this section shall be exercisable by the High Court or by a county court, and shall be exercisable by a county court notwithstanding that by reason of the amount of the net annual value for rating of the dwelling house or otherwise the jurisdiction would not but for this subsection be exercisable by a county court. 10 This Act shall not apply to a dwelling house which has at no time been a matrimonial home of the spouses in question; and a spouse\u2019s rights of occupation shall continue only so long as the marriage subsists and the other spouse is entitled as mentioned in subsection (1) above to occupy the dwelling house, except where provision is made by section 2 of this Act for those rights to be a charge on an estate or interest in the dwelling house. 11 It is hereby declared that a spouse who has an equitable interest in a dwelling house or in the proceeds of sale thereof, not being a spouse in whom is vested (whether solely or as a joint tenant) a legal estate in fee simple or a legal term of years absolute in the dwelling house, is to be treated for the purpose only of determining whether he or she has rights of occupation under this section as not being entitled to occupy the dwelling house by virtue of that interest."}, {"act": "Matrimonial Homes Act 1983 (repealed

the estate or interest, b the date of the marriage, and c the 1st January 1968 (which is the date of commencement of the Act of 1967). 2 If, at any time when a spouse\u2019s rights of occupation are a charge on an interest of the other spouse under a trust, there are, apart from either of the spouses, no persons, living or unborn, who are or could become beneficiaries under the trust, then those rights shall be a charge also on the estate or interest of the trustees for the other spouse, having the like priority as if it were an equitable interest created (under powers overriding the trusts)

bound by the charge, the surrender shall have effect subject to the charge and the persons thereafter entitled to the other estate or interest shall, for so long as the estate or interest surrendered would have endured if not so surrendered, be treated for all purposes of this Act as deriving title to the other estate or interest under the other spouse or, as the case may be, under the trustees
